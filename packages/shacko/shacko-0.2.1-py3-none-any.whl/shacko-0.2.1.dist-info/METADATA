# Homeless Framework

**Homeless:** tested in the toughest times. ✅

A web framework born out of necessity, grown in tough conditions, and ready to
lend a hand when you think everything's falling apart. Because when you're
"homeless", the only thing left to do is build something solid.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install Homeless

We'll use `uv` as the "all-in-one" tool. Thanks, uv, for making it worth every
second spent installing it, after all, time isn't exactly on our side. Easy
install [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer).

**Tip:** in a pinch, `uv --help` won't let you down.

So go ahead with:

```bash
# Linux
cd /tmp  # Is there a better place? (more on this later)
# Line by line and self explanatory:
uv init testdrive
cd testdrive
uv add homeless
```

Output:

```bash
Resolved 2 packages in 182ms
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ [0/1] Installing wheels...
Installed 1 package in 0.98ms
 + homeless==0.1.0
```

Let's see:

```bash
❯ uv run python
Python 3.12.7 (main, Oct  1 2024, 08:52:11) [GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from homeless import hello
>>> hello()
'Hello from homeless!'
>>> exit()
```

Oh, boy.

### Write your first project

You don't need much to get started, just an idea and some code. Build something,
and you might even find a real home and finally escape `/tmp`, or at least land
a good bug fix.

### Tested in the toughest times

We've all been "homeless" at the start. This framework has been tested in chaos,
tough times, and sleepless nights.

## Main goals

If we're lucky, stay warm.

## 📜 Documentation

Think of the docs as a house under construction, it's not quite finished yet,
but it's getting better every day. The ~~core~~ ~~onl^H~~ docs are at [the docs page](https://github.com/homeless-framework/homeless]), and like any good
shelter, they're growing stronger with each update. Need a hand?  Documentation
contributions are always welcome!

## 🤔 Why "Homeless"?

Because every great idea starts from hardship. "Homeless" isn't just a name,
it's a philosophy: start from nothing and build something that lasts. And if
you're lucky, maybe you'll find a home. Or at least a solid app.

### ➡️ Roadmap

Let's get there before the cold of the winter gets too cold! It doesn't have to
end to be
finished on the streets.

### 💡 About Homeless

Homeless isn't just a name, part 2; it's a story of starting from scratch and
building something solid when everything else seems uncertain. Born from
real-life challenges, this framework embodies the idea that the toughest times
can spark the most creative solutions.

Homeless is for anyone who's ever had to build something from nothing, whether
you're coding in a coffee shop, working from a temporary shelter, or just trying
to make sense of things when everything feels up in the air.

This framework is proof that, even when life is tough, you can still build tools
that matter. One line of code at a time.

- 💪 From nothing to something
- 🏗️ Building stability through code
- 🤝 A community that gets it
- 🔗 Built from the ground up, connecting everything

### 🤝 Contributing

Got some free time (and maybe a roof over your head)? Contribute to improving
Homeless! There's nothing better than building together.

### 🛠️ Support
