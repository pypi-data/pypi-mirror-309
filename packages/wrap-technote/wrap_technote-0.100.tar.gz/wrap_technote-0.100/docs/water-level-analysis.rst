Groundwater level analysis
--------------------------

Data is in the form of manual readings of water level (WL), taken at irregular intervals (anywhere from weekly to six-monthly). These manual readings are stored in SA Geodata. WL data recorded on continuous loggers is also retrieved - where it exists - from Hydstra. When it is retrieved, for reasons of efficiency, the average water level per week is retrieved. 

SA Geodata readings have some metadata attached to each WL observation. The most important fields are:

- measured_during e.g. 'M', 'R', 'D'. These are colour-coded in the WL data validation figure (https://github.com/dew-waterscience/wrap_technote/blob/81975cd2ab32cbb9005032b0bcbe92fe3c29f445/wrap_technote/charts.py#L77)
