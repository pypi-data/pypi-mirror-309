    Description
    -----------
    Displays a list of files in a Stage.

    Refer to `Stage <https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/developer-resources/stage-storage-service/>`_
    for more information.

    Arguments
    ---------
    * ``<group_id>``: The ID of the workspace group in which
      the Stage is attached.
    * ``<group_name>``: The name of the workspace group in which
      the Stage is attached.
    * ``<path>``: A path in the Stage.
    * ``<pattern>``: A pattern similar to SQL LIKE clause.
      Uses ``%`` as the wildcard character.

    Remarks
    -------
    * Use the ``LIKE`` clause to specify a pattern and return only the
      files that match the specified pattern.
    * The ``LIMIT`` clause limits the number of results to the
      specified number.
    * Use the ``ORDER BY`` clause to sort the results by the specified
      key. By default, the results are sorted in the ascending order.
    * The ``AT PATH`` clause specifies the path in the Stage to list
      the files from.
    * The ``IN GROUP`` clause specifies the ID or the name of the
      workspace group in which the Stage is attached.
    * Use the ``RECURSIVE`` clause to list the files recursively.
    * To return more information about the files, use the ``EXTENDED``
      clause.

    Examples
    --------
    The following command lists the files at a specific path::

        SHOW STAGE FILES IN GROUP 'wsg1' AT PATH "/data/";

    The following command lists the files recursively with
    additional information::

        SHOW STAGE FILES IN GROUP 'wsg1' RECURSIVE EXTENDED;
