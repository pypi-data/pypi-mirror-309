# viashpy
Various tools and utilities to interact with [viash](https://viash.io/) using python.

# Installation
To install viashpy, you can do so from the python package index [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) using `pip`.

```bash
pip install viashpy
```

# Running the tests
To run the tests, clone the repository and install the development requirements by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
pip install .[dev] # Do not forget to quote this if you are using zsh
```

By default, viashpy can tested against different python versions (more specifically 3.8 to 3.13) using `tox`. 
These versions of python must be made available to tox (by adding them to your `PATH` environment variable), for example by installing and enabling them using `pyenv`.

Afterwards, running the tests is a matter of executing: 
```bash
tox
```

Alternatively, if you wish to test for the python version installed on your system only, you can choose to only test `-e` parameter.
```bash
# Uses python3.8
tox -e py3.8
```
