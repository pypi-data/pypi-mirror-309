This module is responsible for parsing the configuration file.
It reads the configuration file and returns the provider and its configuration as a dictionary.
It also provides a function to determine if a local shelf should be used based on the file extension.

At this level, the only necessary configuration is the provider name.
Other configurations are loaded into a dictionary and passed to the provider for further configuration.
