    # more likely that you want to send everything (and e.g. be able to see
    # which user was affected by a certain event). Uncomment the following line
    # to send PII.

    # The SDK's default is to be quite conservative with the nr of local
    # variables it sends per frame (the default is is 10). If you want to see
    # more, you may either proceed with the monkey patching described in the
    # issue below, or set max_request_body_size to "always" (which will send
    # everything). Note that this may lead to very large messages, which may be
    # dropped by the server (but the server is under your control, so you can
    # change that). see https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/377

    # Setting up the release is highly recommended. The SDK will try to infer
    # it, but explicitly setting it is more reliable.
