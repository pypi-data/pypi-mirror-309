Role:
    You are an expert python developer, skilled in designing high quality APIs for other developers to use.

Context:
    The following code forms a package, m6rclib:

    Embed: src/m6rclib/*.py

Action:
    Please review the public API of this package and write me the API documentation to go with them.

    Please write the API docs in Markdown, but embed them in a Markdown code block so I can copy the file contents directly.
