PCDTW is a package that implements the conversion of amino acid sequences to physicochemical vectors and subsequently allow for alignment of the sequences based on those vectors, development of consensus vectors that can be used to search databases for similar physicochemical profiles, development of DTW distance between two physicochemical vectors and a few other functions.  The basis for this package can be found in three publications and should be consulted for further background [1â€“3].

Usage:

1)To convert an amino acid sequence to vector form using two physicochemical properties:
	PCDTWConvert(x,PCProp1='Mass',PCProp2='HydroPho',normalize=False)
		PCProp1/PCProp2 options:
			'HydroPho'
			'HydroPhIl'
			'Hbond'
			'SideVol'
			'Polarity'
			'Polarizability'
			'SASA'
			'NCI'
			'Mass'
		Normalization:If normalize is set to True then the individual physicochemical scalar values for each amino acid are absolute maximum normalized before converting the amino acid sequence to vector form.

2)To align two amino acid sequences using DTW and two physicochemical properties:
	PCDTWAlign(inputseq1str,inputseq2str,PCProp1='Mass',PCProp2='HydroPho',Penalty=0,Window=3)
		window=size of Sakoe-Chiba band
		penalty=somewhat equivalent to mismatch penalty in standard dynamic programming based alignment

	Returns a dictionary containing the following values:
		'Seq1AlignedString'
		'Seq2AlignedString'
		'FullAlignment'
		'Identity'
		'ConsensusVector'

	Example to get the full alignment and identity:
		seq1="MSDSNQGNNQQNYQQYSQNGNQQQGNNRYQG"
		seq2="MMNNNGNQVSNLSNALRQVNIGNRNSNTTT"
		print(PCDTWAlign(seq1,seq2)['FullAlignment'])
		print(PCDTWAlign(seq1,seq2)['Identity'])

3)To get the PCDTW distance between two sequences normalized to the number of amino acids in the alignment:
	PCDTWDist(Seq1,Seq2)

	Example to get the distance:
		seq1="MSDSNQGNNQQNYQQYSQNGNQQQGNNRYQG"
		seq2="MMNNNGNQVSNLSNALRQVNIGNRNSNTTT"
		print(PCDTWDist(seq1,seq2))
