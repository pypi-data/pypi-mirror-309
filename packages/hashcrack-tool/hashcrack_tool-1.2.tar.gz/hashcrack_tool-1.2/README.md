## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

#### Linux:
- **OS**: Any Linux distribution
- **Programs**:
  - **Hashcat**: Install from [hashcat.net](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
  - **Optional**: For WPA2 cracking, additional tools like [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/), [hcxtools](https://github.com/zkryss/hcxtools), and [hcxdumptool](https://github.com/fg8/hcxdumptool) are recommended.
  
**Distribution-specific Commands**:
- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install hashcat aircrack-ng hcxtools hcxdumptool python3 python3-pip git
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install hashcat aircrack-ng hcxtools hcxdumptool python3 python3-pip git
  ```
- **Arch Linux/Manjaro**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S hashcat aircrack-ng hcxtools hcxdumptool python python-pip git
  ```

#### Windows:
- **OS**: Windows 10 or later
- **Programs**:
  - **Hashcat**: Download the Windows version from [hashcat.net](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
  - **Python**: Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - **Optional**: For a Linux-like environment, set up [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

> [!TIP]
> Recommended wordlists, rules, and masks can be found in repositories like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) and [wpa2-wordlists](https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists.git). It’s advised to keep these resources in `hashCrack` under `wordlists`, `rules`, and `masks` folders for better compatibility.

### Cloning and Running hashCrack
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ente0v1/hashCrack.git
   cd hashCrack
   ```
2. **Download default wordlists and rules**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ente0v1/hashcat-defaults
   git lfs install
   git pull
   cd ..
   cp -rf hashcat-defaults/* .
   sudo rm -r hashcat-defaults
   ```
3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Place the hash**:
   ```bash
   mv hash.txt hashCrack
   ```
5. **Run hashCrack**:

</p>

> [!TIP]
> To verify and check for any missing dependencies, execute the `check_dependencies.py` script. Run the following command:
```
python check_dependencies.py
```

### Alternative Installation via pip

If you prefer a simpler installation method, you can install `hashCrack` via pip:

1. **Install hashCrack with pip**:
   You can install `hashCrack` directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install hashcrack
   ```

2. **Running hashCrack**:
   After installation, you can easily run `hashCrack` by specifying the hash file you want to crack:
   ```bash
   hashcrack yourhashfile.txt
   ```

This approach eliminates the need to clone the repository, making it a quick and efficient way to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you encounter any issues with installing dependencies, such as permission errors or system-wide installation restrictions, you can either create a virtual environment or install the dependencies as root.

### If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails

Creating a Python virtual environment is optional but recommended if you run into issues with installing dependencies system-wide. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment:

1. **Install Python and pip** (if you haven't already):

   - On Arch Linux:
     ```
     sudo pacman -S python python-pip
     ```

   - On Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:
     ```
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
     ```

   - On Fedora:
     ```
     sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
     ```

   - On Windows, Python and pip can be installed from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   - Run the following commands to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - **Activate the virtual environment**:
     - On Linux:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

     - On Windows:
       ```
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python packages using `pip`:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage Overview

### Capturing WPA2 Hashes
To capture WPA2 hashes, follow [this guide on the 4-way handshake](https://notes.networklessons.com/security-wpa-4-way-handshake) and see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfYxrLaqlN8) to see how it actually works. Capture scripts are provided in the `scripts` folder.

### Cracking the Hash
1. Rename the hash file to `hash.txt` and place it in the `hashCrack` directory.
2. Start cracking with:
   ```bash
   python hashCrack.py
   ```
3. The cracking results will be stored in `logs`, specifically in `status.txt`.

### Attack Modes
hashCrack supports the following attack modes:
| # | Mode                 | Description                                                                                   |
|---|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | Straight             | Uses a wordlist directly to attempt cracks                                                    |
| 1 | Combination          | Combines two dictionaries to produce candidate passwords                                      |
| 3 | Brute-force          | Attempts every possible password combination based on a specified character set               |
| 6 | Hybrid Wordlist + Mask | Uses a wordlist combined with a mask to generate variations                                 |
| 7 | Hybrid Mask + Wordlist | Uses a mask combined with a wordlist for generating password candidates                     |
| 9 | Association          | For specific hash types where known data is combined with brute-force attempts                |

| Q      | Quit                       | Saves settings, logs, and exits |

### Example Commands
```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 400 example400.hash example.dict              # Wordlist
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example0.hash example.dict -r best64.rule   # Wordlist + Rules
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example0.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a                  # Brute-Force
hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example0.hash example.dict example.dict     # Combination

## Troubleshooting Hashcat Issues

If you encounter errors when running Hashcat, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Test Hashcat Functionality**:
   First, run a benchmark test to ensure that Hashcat is working properly:
   ```bash
   hashcat -b
   ```
   This command will perform a benchmark on your system to check Hashcat's overall functionality. If this command works without issues, Hashcat is likely properly installed.

2. **Check Available Devices**:
   To verify that Hashcat can detect your devices (such as GPUs) for cracking, use the following command:
   ```bash
   hashcat -I
   ```
   This command will list the available devices. Ensure that the correct devices are listed for use in cracking.



3. **Check for Errors in Hashcat**:
   If the cracking process fails or Hashcat doesn't seem to recognize your devices, running the above tests should help identify potential problems with your system configuration, such as missing or incompatible drivers.

4. **Permissions**:
   If you encounter permission issues (especially on Linux), consider running Hashcat with elevated privileges or configuring your user group correctly for GPU access. You can run Hashcat with `sudo` if necessary:
   ```bash
   sudo hashcat -b
   ```

## Script Walkthrough

The main hashCrack script consists of:
1. **Initialization**: Loads default parameters and reusable functions.
2. **User Prompts**: Gathers inputs from the user such as wordlist location, session names, and attack type.
3. **Command Construction**: Constructs the Hashcat command based on user inputs and specified attack mode.
4. **Execution**: Runs the cracking session with or without status timers.
5. **Logging**: Saves session settings and logs the results for future reference.
