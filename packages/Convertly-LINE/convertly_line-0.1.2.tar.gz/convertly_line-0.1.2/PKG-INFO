# CONVERTLY: A PYTHON LIBRARY FOR DATA CONVERSION

The general idea of this library called Convertly is to provide an easy tool to convert various units such as measures, currency and time.

To develop this library and create a converter, a set of functions was created. These functions allow for the conversion of various measurements and currencies, as well as the ability to convert time between different countries.

## Functions:
* Measure converter
    - It will be possible to convert measures in the International System of Units, in the imperial and US customary measurement systems and in between both of them.
    - Measurements of length (m), mass (kg), time (s), thermodynamic temperature (K), etc. can be converted.
* Time converter
    - Convert the time of one country to another.
* Currency converter
	You can convert currencies around the world.
