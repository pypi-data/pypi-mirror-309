# Solution 1: Go to Anthropic with a rubber hose and employ said hose until they increase rate limits
#
# Solution 2: Implement a rate limit handler.
#
# Conclusion: Solution 2 is less likely to invite liability, therefore solution 2 is the correct approach. Get coding!
#
# However, keep following letter handy in case I don't implement solution 2 in reasonable time:
#
# Dear Anthropic,
#
# I've developed a semantic testing library for LLM applications that's gaining traction (72 clones in 2 days). While implementing tests using Claude, I've encountered some rate limiting challenges.
#
# I've documented two potential solutions:
# 1. Implement a rate limit handler (boring but professional)
# 2. Visit Anthropic with a rubber hose (legally inadvisable)
#
# I've chosen Solution 1, but I'd love to discuss increasing the rate limits for testing purposes. This would save me both development time and potential legal expenses from rubber hose-related incidents.

# Best regards,
