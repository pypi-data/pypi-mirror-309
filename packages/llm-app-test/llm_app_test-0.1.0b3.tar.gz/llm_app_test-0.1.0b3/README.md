# llm_app_test

A semantic testing framework for LLM applications that uses LLMs to validate semantic equivalence in test outputs. 

‚ú® Test your LLM apps in minutes, not hours

üöÄ CI/CD ready out of the box

üí∞ Cost-effective testing solution

üîß No infrastructure needed

Important note: This is still being tested prior to release on PyPI, please refer to the branch: feat/find-a-way-to-break-this and look in the tests directory to see where we're at on the dumbest edge cases (e.g. 100 emojis).

## What llm_app_test Does
- Tests LLM applications (not the LLMs themselves)
- Validates system message + prompt template outputs
- Ensures semantic equivalence of responses
- Tests the parts YOU control in your LLM application

## What llm_app_test Doesn't Do
- Test LLM model performance (that's the provider's responsibility)
- Validate base model capabilities
- Test model reliability
- Handle model safety features

## Screenshots

What if you could just use:

```
semantic_assert.assert_semantic_match(
        actual=actual_output,
        expected_behavior=expected_behavior
    )
```
and get a pass/fail to test your LLM apps? Well, that's what I'm trying to do. Anyway, seeing is believing so:

Here's llm_app_test passing a test case:

![test_pass.jpg](test_pass.jpg)

Here's llm_app_test failing a test case (and providing the reason why it failed):

![test_fail.jpg](test_fail.jpg)

Finally, here's llm_app_test passing a test case with a complex reasoning chain with the simple, natural language 
instruction of:

```
A complex, multi-step, scientific explanation.
Must maintain logical consistency across all steps.

## Why llm_app_test?

Testing LLM applications is challenging because:
- Outputs are non-deterministic
- Semantic meaning matters more than exact matches
- Traditional testing approaches don't work well
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines is complex

llm_app_test solves these challenges by:
- Using LLMs to evaluate semantic equivalence
- Providing a clean, maintainable testing framework
- Offering simple CI/CD integration
- Supporting multiple LLM providers

## When to Use llm_app_test
- Testing application-level LLM integration
- Validating prompt engineering
- Testing system message effectiveness
- Ensuring consistent response patterns

## When Not to Use llm_app_test
- Testing base LLM performance
- Evaluating model capabilities
- Testing model safety features

## Quick Example

```
from llm_app_test.semanticassert.semantic_assert import SemanticAssertion

semantic_assert = SemanticAssertion() 
semantic_assert.assert_semantic_match(actual="Hello Alice, how are you?", 
                                      expected_behavior="A polite greeting addressing Alice" 
                                      )
```

## Contributing

This project is at an early stage and aims to be an important testing library for LLM applications. 

Want to contribute? Great! Some areas we're looking for help:
- Additional LLM provider support
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation
- CI/CD integration examples
- Test result caching
- Literally anything else you can think of, I'm all out of ideas, I'm not even sure starting this project was a smart one.
