------------------------------------------

Textual-PyFiglet is an implementation of [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet) for [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

It provides a `FigletWidget` which is designed to be easy to use inside of Textual.

# Key features


### Textual-PyFiglet is a fork of PyFiglet:

The original PyFiglet has zero dependencies, since it's a full re-write of [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/) in Python. I've aimed to recreate this light-weight nature as much as possible. Textual-PyFiglet has one dependency, [platformdirs](https://github.com/tox-dev/platformdirs/)

The full git history of PyFiglet is properly preserved.

### Extended fonts collection moved to separate package:

If you want the whole collection, simply use:   
`pip install textual-pyfiglet[fonts]`

The included 10 fonts were chosen for being minimalist and normal-looking

PyFiglet wheel: **1.1 MB**.  -->   Textual-PyFiglet wheel: **71 KB**.

Most of the size of PyFiglet is just the massive fonts collection, 519 in total. In the base textual-pyfiglet package I've included only 10 of the best minimal fonts. I've also made it easy to download the full collection for those who still want it (use extended fonts install, shown at the top)

### Widget easily drops into your Textual app:

The widget is based on `Static` and is designed to mimick its behavior. That means it can drop-in replace any Static widget, and it should just work without even adding or changing arguments (using default font). Assuming you're accounting for the size of the text somehow.

You can dynamically set the size (ie 1fr, 100%) as you would with any Textual widget. It will respond automatically to any widget resize events, and re-draw the figlet. If the widget is set to the screen size, PyFiglet will wrap to the screen.

### Real-time updating:

As you would expect with a good Figlet program, the text can update in real-time as you type, or receive input from whatever else you desire.

It's easy to implement in your own Textual app. See below.

# Usage

### Demo program, CLI:
Run the demo program with either:   
`textual-pyfiglet`   
Or:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet`

PyFiglet also has its own CLI which has been kept available. (Which has its own built-in demo program.) You can access the PyFiglet CLI with:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet`

Try it out to see the options. For instance, try running this code:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet Hey guys, whats up?`   

# How to use:

FigletWidget is designed to be used like a normal Static widget.

You can simply create one with the  Textual syntax:

```python
from textual_pyfiglet import FigletWidget

def compose(self):
   yield FigletWidget("Label of Things", id="figlet1")
```

In this case it will use the default font, Calvin_s. You can also specify a font in the constructor:

```python
yield FigletWidget("Label of Things", id="figlet1" font="small")
```

## Resizing

The FigletWidget will auto-update the rendering area whenever it gets resized.   
Internally it uses Textual's `on_resize` method. So it will work automatically.   
Just set the widget to the size you want, and PyFiglet will render what it can in that space.   

## Change the font / Justification

The widget will update automatically when this is run:
```python
self.query("#figlet1").set_font("small")
```
| Base fonts  |                |
|-------------|----------------|
| calvin_s    | smblock
| chunky      | smbraille 
| cybermedium | standard
| small_slant | stick_letters
| small       | tmplr

If the extended fonts pack is not installed, the widget will do a quick check every launch to see if its been downloaded. So you can install it afterwards any time you feel like it.


To set the justification, use this method. Options are 'left', 'right', 'center', 'auto'
```python
self.query("#figlet1").set_justify("left")
```

## Live updating / Passing text

To update the FigletWidget with new text, simply pass it in the update method:

```python
self.query_one("#figlet1").update("New text here")
```

For instance, if you have a TextArea widget where a user can enter text, you can do this:

```python
@on(TextArea.Changed)
def text_changed(self):
   text = self.query_one("#text_input").text
   self.query_one("#figlet1").update(text)
```
The FigletWidget will then auto-update with every key-stroke.   
Note that you cannot pass in a Rich renderable, like the normal Static widget - the text has to be a normal string for PyFiglet to work.

You can access two lists of installed fonts through this method in the FigletWidget:

```python
figlet1 = self.query_one("#figlet1")
all_fonts = figlet1.get_fonts_list(get_all=True)
base_fonts = figlet1.get_fonts_list(get_all=False)  # only get standard 10
```

## Regular PyFiglet / String

You can still import PyFiglet and use it normally:

```python
from textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet import Figlet         # class version
from textual_Pyfiglet.pyfiglet import figlet_format  # function version
```

If you just need a quick way to grab a figlet as a string, the `pyfiglet.figlet_format` function is often the easiest. There's also two convenience methods in the FigletWidget class:

```python
self.query_one("#figlet1").copy_text_to_clipboard()
```
```python
fig_string = self.query_one("#figlet1").return_figlet_as_string()
```
