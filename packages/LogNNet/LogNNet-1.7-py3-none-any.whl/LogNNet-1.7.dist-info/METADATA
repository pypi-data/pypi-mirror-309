# LogNNet Neural Network

LogNNet is a neural network [1,2] that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks, alongside other networks such as MLP, RNN, CNN, LSTM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. One of the key advantages of LogNNet is its use of a customizable chaotic reservoir, which is represented as a weight matrix filled with chaotic mappings. In this version, a congruent generator is used, producing a sequence of chaotically changing numbers. The matrix transformation, based on optimized sequences of chaotic weights, enhances the identification of patterns in data. While LogNNet follows the structure of a traditional feedforward neural network, its chaotic transformation of the input space grants it properties similar to reservoir networks

LogNNet is particularly efficient for resource-constrained devices, and early versions demonstrated high performance on platforms such as Arduino [3] and IoT technologies [4,5]. This efficiency is achieved through the congruent generator, which can generate a large number of weight coefficients from only four parameters. This approach allows for the discovery of optimal weight sequences tailored to specific tasks. Moreover, the weights can be computed "on the fly," significantly reducing memory usage by eliminating the need to store all the weights in advance. Versions of LogNNet designed for low-power devices will be introduced in other GitHub projects.

LogNNet is also used for calculating neural network entropy (NNetEn) [6,7,8,9].

The Python function calls in LogNNet are structured similarly to other neural networks, such as MLP and RNN, utilizing standard stages for training and testing. The optimization of the congruent generatorвЂ™s parameters is performed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and training is conducted with k-fold cross-validation. All network parameters are specified in the documentation. Additionally, LogNNet features a multi-threaded search and parameter optimization function, which enhances performance by allowing parallel searches for optimal values, resulting in faster network tuning for specific tasks.
This version is designed for research purposes and can be used for tasks such as classification, regression (including applications in medicine [10,11]), time series prediction, signal processing, recognition of small images, text analysis, anomaly detection, financial data analysis, and more.

## Usage

### LogNNetRegressor 

Multi-layer LogNNet Regression

```python
from LogNNet.neural_network import LogNNetRegressor

...

model = LogNNetRegressor(
    num_rows_W=(10, 150),
    limit_hidden_layers=((1, 60), (1, 35)),
    learning_rate=(0.001, 0.1),
    n_epochs=(5, 550),
    n_f=-1,
    selected_metric='r2',
    num_folds=1,
    num_particles=10,
    num_threads=10,
    num_iterations=10)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
....
```

### LogNNetClassifier ### 

Multi-layer LogNNet Classification

```python
from LogNNet.neural_network import LogNNetClassifier

...

model = LogNNetClassifier(
    num_rows_W=(10, 150),
    limit_hidden_layers=((1, 60), (1, 35)),
    learning_rate=(0.001, 0.1),
    n_epochs=(5, 550),
    n_f=-1,
    selected_metric='accuracy',
    selected_metric_class=None,
    num_folds=1,
    num_particles=10,
    num_threads=10,
    num_iterations=10)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
...
```

### Import/export of trained LogNNet model

In this project, we have implemented the functionality for importing and exporting the LogNNet model after executing the "fit" function. This allows users to save trained models for later use without the need for retraining.

The import/export capability is an important part of the machine learning development workflow, as it facilitates model sharing between different developers and environments, and conveniently preserves intermediate results. 

Code for saving model to file:
```python
from LogNNet.neural_network import LogNNetRegressor

params = {} # Some parameters

model = LogNNetRegressor(**params)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

model.export_model(file_name='LogNNet_model.joblib')
....
```
If the "file_name" parameter is not specified or is None, a model with the name will be created `{unix_time}_LogNNet_model.joblib`.

Code to load a trained model from a file:
```python
from LogNNet.neural_network import LogNNetRegressor

model = LogNNetRegressor().import_model(file_name='LogNNet_model.joblib')
....
```

### Functionality of perceptron training

This library implements the functionality for retraining the perceptron layer of the LogNNet model while keeping the reservoir parameters fixed. This function is particularly useful for calculating metrics in a k-fold cross-validation setting.

The perceptron retraining process utilizes an already trained LogNNet model, which contains the optimal reservoir and other parameters obtained during the main training phase. The function reloads these pre-trained parameters, ensuring the reservoir remains unchanged, and reinitialized training for the perceptron layer using new input data X and target labels y.

```python
from LogNNet.neural_network import LogNNetClassifier
...
# Importing the finished model
model = LogNNetClassifier().import_model(file_name='LogNNet_model.joblib')

model.fit_MLP(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)
....
```

### Displaying LogNNet Information

After the training of the model or importing a pre-trained LogNNet model, the dictionary "input_layer_data" will be available with the following parameters:

- "W" - Contains the reservoir (weights matrix).
- "prizn_binary" - A string with the mask of used features.
- "Shmax", "Shmin", "X_train_max", "X_train_min" - Normalization coefficients for the formation of neurons in the first hidden layer.

Built-in functions:

- `get_version()` - Returns a string containing the version of the LogNNet library.
- `get_mask_feature()` - Returns a string containing the mask of the used features in the input vector.
- `get_LogNNet_params()` - Returns a dictionary with the parameters of the model obtained after training.
- To get a dictionary with the perciptron parameters, you can use `LogNNet_model.mlp_model.get_params()`, where "LogNNet_model" is the name of the model after initialization.


## How to use examples files

1. Install the package LogNNet [*](https://github.com/izotov93/LogNNet?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
2. Download file [example_LogNNet_classification.py](https://github.com/izotov93/LogNNet/blob/master/example_LogNNet_classification.py) or / and [example_LogNNet_regression.py](https://github.com/izotov93/LogNNet/blob/master/example_LogNNet_regression.py)
3. In the directory where the example script is located, create a folder named `database`
4. Place your CSV database file into the `database` folder

The project structure should be as follows:
```
   your_project_folder/
   в”њв”Ђв”Ђ example_LogNNet_classification.py
   в”њв”Ђв”Ђ example_LogNNet_regression.py
   в””в”Ђв”Ђ database/
       в””в”Ђв”Ђ your_database.csv
```   
5. Configure Parameters 

In both example files there are variables "input_file", "target_column_input_file" and "LogNNet_params".
- input_file - variable containing the name of the *.csv file in the folder "/database/"
- target_column_input_file - variable containing the name of the target column in the input file. 
If the variable is not defined, the first column in the file "input_file" will be selected.
- LogNNet_params - dictionary containing the parameters of the LogNNet neural network [*](https://github.com/izotov93/LogNNet?tab=readme-ov-file#parameters).

6. If changes have been made, you should save the file. Run the example files
7. Once executed, a new directory "LogNNet_results" will be created, which contains a report file named `{unix_time}_metrics_{database_name}.txt` and a file named `{unix_time}_LogNNet_model_{database_name}.joblib` containing the trained model
8. If a regression task was performed, an additional file will be created with the predicted data, file named `{unix_time}_data_{database_name}.txt`
