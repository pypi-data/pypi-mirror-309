# Entropy Classifier

`entropy-classifier` is a Python library for calculating entropy, certainty levels, and classifying data columns based on their uncertainty levels.

## Features
- Calculate entropy for binary and non-binary data.
- Determine certainty levels for passing or failing outcomes.
- Classify columns by their uncertainty levels.

## Installation

```bash
pip install entropy-classifier
