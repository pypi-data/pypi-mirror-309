# `relationalai.Producer.__radd__()`

```python
relationalai.Producer.__radd__(other: Any) -> Expression
```

Returns an [`Expression`](../Expression.md) that produces the sum of the [`Producer`](./README.md) values and `other`.
`.__radd__()` is implemented so that you may use a non-`Producer` object as the left operand.
