Welcome to PLATON's documentation!
==================================
**Oct 30, 2024: PLATON v6.2 is out, with major updates!  This corresponds most closely to the version described in**
`Zhang et al 2024 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22398>`_.
**Major changes include GPU support, free retrievals, surface emission, higher-resolution (R=20k) and more up-to-date opacities, leave-one-out cross-validation, pymultinest, and much better plotting tools.**

**April 18, 2020: PLATON v5.1 corresponds most closely to the version described
in our second PLATON paper.**

**November 29, 2018: PLATON v3.0 is out!  Please check the release notes on GitHub for the list of new features.  Our paper actually describes v2.1, but v3 has a substantial number of improvements, and we strongly recommend everyone use it.**

**October 1, 2018: PLATON v2.0 is out! Please check the release notes for the list of new features, and upgrade.**
