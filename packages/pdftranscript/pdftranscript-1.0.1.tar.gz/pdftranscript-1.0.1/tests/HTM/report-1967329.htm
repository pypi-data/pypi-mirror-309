<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>This inspection was carried out by one additional inspector. Teaching and learning were <br>observed in eight lessons, with all five teachers seen. Meetings were held with students, <br>members of the management committee, staff and a representative from the local <br>authority. The inspector observed the school's work and looked at documentation <br>including the school improvement plan, assessment information, policies and students' <br>work. Fourteen questionnaires from parents and carers were scrutinised.   <br>The inspector reviewed many aspects of the school's work and looked in detail at a <br>number of key areas. </p>
<ul>
<li>The effectiveness of teaching with a focus on the ways in which staff use <br>assessment to improve students' achievements.  
</li>
<li>The success of the school in improving students' behaviour and attendance.   
</li>
<li>The extent to which leaders ensure improvement with a focus on the work of the <br>management committee.  
</li>
<li>The effectiveness of the systems to track students' progress to ensure that all <br>students make the progress of which they are capable and that the school's overall 
<br>performance compares well with the national picture.  
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information about the school </h2>
<p>Agincourt House caters for students from the London Borough of Camden who have <br>usually been excluded from their mainstream schools after a period of disrupted <br>education. Students arrive at the centre at different times but once they are on roll they <br>remain until age 16. All have behavioural, social and emotional difficulties. A small number <br>have a statement of special educational needs related to these as well as to other learning <br>difficulties. The great majority of students are from White British backgrounds. A small <br>minority are from Black African backgrounds. None are at the early stages of speaking <br>English. The proportion of students known to be eligible for free school meals is high. The <br>centre has Healthy School status.  </p>

<h3>Main findings </h3>
<p>Agincourt House provides good education for its students. The care, guidance and support <br>that students receive are outstanding and ensure that students make excellent progress in <br>developing their confidence and self-esteem from a very low base. Students' progress in <br>their academic learning is good and students gain qualifications in a range of GCSE and <br>vocational subjects, through which all are able to move successfully into further education, <br>training or the world of work. The centre uses very effective strategies to re-engage <br>students in education and enable them to address their anxieties about school. Attendance <br>is average overall. Behaviour is good with all students showing great improvement from <br>when they first started at the centre.  <br>The well-balanced curriculum gives a clear focus to the development of basic skills in <br>literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology and engages students <br>very effectively. Teaching and learning are good. Teachers establish excellent relationships <br>with the students and these are the basis of the exemplary guidance and support for <br>students' personal development. Staff know each student extremely well and they use <br>assessment information effectively to match work to the level of understanding of each <br>one. The centre is aware, however, in a few lessons staff do not make the most of every <br>opportunity to involve students in assessing their own learning or that of their peers, for <br>students' achievements to be maximised. Staff training in this aspect is paying off with <br>some excellent practice seen. <br>The headteacher has a very clear vision about how the provision should develop. She is <br>very well supported by her senior management team. Together they have established <br>effective teamwork across the teaching and support staff, based on a good understanding <br>of the centre's strengths and weaknesses. They have mapped out a clear path for <br>improvement. There have been changes in the structure of the management committee <br>since the previous inspection and these are effective in ensuring that it provides the centre <br>with a good level of challenge. The leadership has developed rigorous systems to track <br>students' progress, and monitor and evaluate the quality of the provision, ensuring that <br>any student in need of extra support is quickly identified. These systems form the basis of <br>a well-focused programme of staff development and underpin an effective cycle of school <br>improvement. However, the school does not make best use of its data about students' <br>progress to show clearly to all, particularly its management committee, how well it is <br>performing in relation to the national picture. Excellent links are established with parents <br>and carers to help them to understand and support the needs of their children. <br>Partnerships with other professionals are used extremely well to help meet students' <br>needs, especially to support their personal development. The centre works tirelessly to <br>support students whose circumstances make them vulnerable to overcome their personal <br>difficulties. It makes sure that all students have high-quality opportunities for a 'second <br>chance' in education. The improvements which the centre has effected on students' </p>

<p>Please turn to the glossary for a description of the grades and inspection terms  </p> <p>achievements, their attendance, behaviour and attitudes to learning, coupled with the <br>effectiveness of its self-evaluation, show that the capacity for further sustained <br>improvement is good. </p>
<h3>What does the school need to do to improve further? </h3>
<ul>
<li> Ensure that staff make the most of every opportunity to involve students in <br>assessing their own learning and also that of others in order to maximise students' 
<br>achievements.  
</li>
<li>Use its data about the progress of students more effectively to demonstrate clearly <br>how well it is doing compared to the national picture. 
</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>Outcomes for individuals and groups of pupils </td>
<td>2 </td>
</tr> </table>
<p>Since the previous inspection, the number of students gaining five or more good GCSE <br>passes has risen as has the number attaining passes at grades A* to G, so that attainment <br>is broadly average. Given students' below, and sometimes well below, starting points on <br>entry, this represents good progress and achievement. Students' achievement in English is <br>particularly good. There are no differences in the progress made by different gender, <br>ethnic or ability groups, including for those with a statement of special educational needs. <br>In all the lessons seen, the excellent relationships between staff and students were used <br>extremely well to engage and motivate students so that they enjoy their lessons. In an <br>excellent art lesson the staff were very skilful in involving the students in assessing their <br>learning at all stages of the lesson. This increased the students' determination to succeed, <br>deepened their understanding of difficult concepts related to surrealism and ensured that <br>their learning was of a very high quality. Such practice is not, however, consistent in all <br>lessons.  <br>Students' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is good. This is based on the <br>high expectations established by all staff, the role models they present and the fact they <br>are 'like a supportive family'. Staff are adept at encouraging students to reflect on their <br>own feelings and on those of others and this helps students make significant changes in <br>their attitudes and behaviour. Students develop a good awareness of the need for a <br>healthy lifestyle and this is recognised through the centre's Healthy School status. They <br>are very enthusiastic about timetabled physical education lessons and often take part in <br>voluntary activities, such as jogging on Hampstead Heath and after-school boxing <br>sessions. In discussions, students acknowledged how they have used information about <br>sexual health, tobacco and drug abuse to help change their lifestyle. Students say that <br>they feel safe and if any issues arise they are quickly dealt with by staff.  <br>The first-day absence procedures are operated with rigour and most students improve <br>their attendance considerably. Students make a positive contribution to their school <br>community in a range of ways; for example they have gained funds that have contributed <br>to furnishing a communal area and run events that have helped towards a residential visit. <br>When selling tee shirts of their own design for charity they contributed well to the wider <br>community. The literacy, numeracy and information and communication technology <br>qualifications students gain, together with the gains in their personal skills, prepare them <br>well for their economic well-being.  </p>

<h3>How effective is the provision? </h3>
<p>Teachers have very good subject knowledge and in their planning they identify the needs <br>of individual students and how these will be met, so that the range of activities is carefully <br>matched to students' needs. Support staff receive a high level of training and they make <br>an important contribution to the team, both in helping to manage students' behaviour, <br>develop their understanding and in one-to-one sessions, particularly in reading. All staff <br>use resources, including information and communication technology well, to support <br>students' learning and they often inject a sense of fun into lessons. In many lessons, staff <br>engage students well in checking what they have learnt, with useful prompts from the 'I <br>can do' statements that are available for each subject. In a few lessons opportunities to <br>extend learning in this way are not used to advantage. <br>The curriculum provides a good balance between academic and vocational subjects and <br>meets the needs and aspirations of students. A carefully planned programme of work <br>experience supports the provision. Visits out of school, such as recent one to see <br>basketball at the O2 arena, a wide range of after-school clubs and visitors to the school, <br>for example by local police, enhance the curriculum well. There is a strong focus on <br>personal and social education which forms a cornerstone of the provision. The centre <br>recognises that the provision in information and communication technology is not as <br>established as in other subjects and is rightly developing it further. </p>


<p>Inspect ion grades: 1 is outstanding, 2 is good, 3 is sat isfactory, and 4 is inadequate  </p>
<p>Please turn to the glossary for a description of the grades and inspection terms  </p> <p>Staff make sure that all students, including those who arrive at different times, settle <br>quickly and happily into the centre. Transition arrangements for those moving on, for <br>example to sixth forms and colleges, are excellent and contribute extremely well to <br>reducing students' anxieties. The care, guidance and support provided by all staff for <br>students' personal development are second to none. Staff spend a great deal of time <br>listening to students, giving them advice and promoting their well-being to overcome <br>difficulties in their lives. They work extremely well with others, including parents and <br>carers, mentors, the home/school link worker, the education welfare service and other <br>professionals to provide tailor-made advice and support. Students are given excellent <br>guidance about careers and opportunities available when they leave the centre.  </p>

<h3>How effective are leadership and management? </h3>
<p>The headteacher leads by example and inspires both students and staff to want to do their <br>best. There is a constant focus on improving students' life chances and all show a sense of <br>enthusiasm about key developments with a clear focus on improving practice in <br>classrooms. The management committee is systematic in monitoring the work of the <br>centre. Its members have a good awareness of the centre's strengths and weaknesses <br>and challenge leaders effectively. The centre promotes equality of opportunity well <br>ensuring good achievement for all groups of students, including those who have a <br>statement of special educational needs. The difference it makes to the lives of its students <br>is a testament to its commitment to tackling discrimination. <br>All staff work extremely well with parents and carers to help them to support their <br>children's needs. Links are established through half-termly review meetings, parents' <br>group meetings, first-day absence calls, regular contact by phone and visits home that <br>include time for student tuition if needed. The centre has very systematic procedures for <br>checking the views of parents and carers and it responds very positively to their <br>suggestions. Safeguarding and child protection are high on everyone's agenda and fully <br>meet national requirements and guidelines. There are effective safeguarding policies, with <br>good staff training on child protection. All staff are vetted and checked before working in <br>the centre and risk assessments are thorough. The centre works extremely well with many <br>agencies, other schools and colleges, to underpin the significant progress students make <br>in their attitudes, behaviour and attendance.  <br>The backgrounds of both students and staff, and work undertaken with others in the <br>community, are used well to support students' understanding of community cohesion. <br>Links with a school outside the area have helped to broaden students' understanding of </p>

The school is aware that, as yet, there are too few <br>opportunities for its students to learn about lives of others in an international context and <br>it is rightly developing this area of its work.  </p>

<h3>Views of parents and carers </h3>
<p>A higher-than-usual number of parents' and carers' questionnaires was returned for a <br>school of this type. These show that the overwhelming majority are very satisfied with the <br>centre and the provision it makes for their children. Comments such as, 'They have <br>worked miracles with my son,' sum this up. The views expressed confirmed the findings of <br>the school's own surveys. These very positive views are fully supported by the inspection <br>findings. </p>


<p>Responses from parents and carers to Ofsted's questionnaire </p>
<p>Ofsted invited all the registered parents and carers of pupils registered at Agincourt House to complete a <br>questionnaire about their views of the school.   <br>In the questionnaire, parents and carers were asked to record how strongly they agreed with 13 statements </p>
<p>about the school.  </p>
<p>The inspector received 14 completed questionnaires by the end of the on-site inspection. In total, there are <br>22 pupils registered at the school.  <br>The table above summarises the responses that parents and carers made to each statement. The <br>percentages indicate the proportion of parents and carers giving that response out of the total number of <br>completed questionnaires. Where one or more parents and carers chose not to answer a particular question, <br>the percentages will not add up to 100%.  </p>

<p>New school inspection arrangements were introduced on 1 September 2009. This means that inspectors now <br>make some additional judgements that were not made previously.   <br>The data in the table above are for the period 1 September 2009 to 31 August 2010 and are consistent with <br>the latest published official statistics about maintained school inspec tion outcomes (see </p>
<p>www.ofsted.gov.uk).  </p>
<p>The sample of schools inspected during 2009/10 was not representative of all schools nationally, as weaker <br>schools are inspected more frequently than good or outstanding schools.  <br>Percentages are rounded and do not always add exactly to 100.   <br>Sixth form figures reflect the judgements made for the overall effectiveness of the sixth form in secondary <br>schools, special schools and pupil referral units.   </p>

<p>11 March 2011  <br>Dear Students  </p> <p>Inspection of Agincourt House, London NW3 2NY  </p>
<p>I really enjoyed coming to inspect your school. I judged that Agincourt House provides <br>good education. I could see that you are happy being at the centre and you make <br>excellent progress in developing your confidence and self-esteem. You make good <br>progress in the subjects you study and gain a range of qualifications that help you move <br>on successfully to the next stage of your lives. The school keeps you safe and there is <br>always someone to look after you, give you extra support, for example to help you catch <br>up with your work, and give you advice, for instance about what courses you might study <br>at college. Your behaviour is much improved since you joined Agincourt House and is now <br>good.  <br>I could see that you enjoy football, table tennis and activities, such as making pancakes to <br>celebrate Shrove Tuesday. You told me that you particularly like visits out of the centre, <br>for example to the O2 and activities undertaken in the various clubs. <br>To improve Agincourt House in future I have asked the staff to use the information about <br>the progress you make to make it clearer to everyone how well the centre is doing overall. <br>I have also asked the staff to make sure that in all lessons they make the most of <br>opportunities to involve you in assessing your own work as well as that of others in the <br>class, for example by using the 'I can' ladders. This is to improve your achievements even <br>more. I hope all of you will help by doing your best all of the time.  <br>Yours sincerely  </p>
<p>Kay Charlton  <br>Lead inspector </p>
