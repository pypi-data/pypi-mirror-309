<h3>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION</h3>
<h3> AND CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
<h8>Preface</h8><p>By the end of 2008, at least 7.1 million (67 percent) of 10.6 million Palestinians worldwide were forcibly displaced <br>persons. Among them are at least 6.6 million Palestinian refugees and 427,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). <br>Palestinians are one of the largest displaced populations in the world today, constituting half of all refugees worldwide. <br>Palestinian  refugees fall  into three general categories:  the largest  group (5.7  million) is composed  of 1948  refugees, </p>
<p>among them, 4.7 million UNRWA registered refugees. 1967 refugees (955,247) form the second major group. The third </p>
<p>category is comprised of an unknown number of Palestinians who are neither 1948 nor 1967 refugees but who have also <br>been displaced outside the area of historical Palestine (Israel and the OPT) and are likely to be refugees.  <br>There are two main categories of Palestinian IDPs. The ﬁrst (335,000) is composed of Palestinians who have been <br>internally displaced inside Israel since 1948. The second (129,000) is composed of Palestinians who have been internally <br>displaced in the OPT since 1967. Among the second category are approximately 37,000 Palestinian refugees who have <br>suffered multiple displacement in the OPT.<br>There is no single authoritative source for the global Palestinian refugee and IDP population. Estimates of the current <br>size of Palestinian refugee and IDP populations are based on available data which is uneven and shifting, primarily due <br>to the absence of a comprehensive registration system, frequent forced displacement, and the lack of a uniform deﬁnition <br>of a Palestinian refugee.<br>The majority of the Palestinian refugee and IDP population is distributed throughout the Middle East, primarily in Arab <br>countries that border Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). Most Palestinian refugees (approximately 81 <br>percent) live outside the 58 UNRWA-serviced camps. <br>No data is available on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Palestinian refugee populations outside <br>UNRWA’s area of operation, and little reliable data is available on the characteristics of internally displaced Palestinians <br>in Israel and the OPT. Available data suggests that differences between the Palestinian refugee populations and the local <br>non-refugee populations are negligible in most Arab host states, with Lebanon constituting the only major exception. <br>Demographic and socio-economic indicators, such as labor force indicators, poverty,  housing, education and health, <br>reﬂect the vulnerability of Palestinian refugees during six decades of displacement, especially in Lebanon and the OPT.</p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<h5>2.1 The Current Scope of Palestinian Displacement</h5>
<p>The Palestinian refugee and IDP population described here comprises the total estimated number of Palestinians <br>and  their  descendants  who  have  been  forcibly  displaced  from  their  homes  and  properties  located  in  former <br>Palestine (now divided into Israel and the OPT) and do not have  access to voluntary  durable solutions and <br>reparation, including return to their homes of origin and property restitution. Estimates are for the end of 2008, <br>unless stated otherwise. Information about the methodology applied is included in Appendix 2.1 at the end of <br>this chapter.<br>By the end of 2008, at least 7.1 million (67 percent) of the entire, worldwide Palestinian population of 10.6 million</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>were forcibly displaced persons. Among them were at least 6.6 million Palestinian refugees and approximately <br>427,000 IDPs. <br>The largest group of displaced Palestinians is made up of those who were forced to leave their homes and country <br>in 1948 (the Nakba) and their descendants. These total approximately 5.7 million, a ﬁgure that includes the 4.7 <br>million Palestinian refugees who are registered with and assisted by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine <br>Refugees (UNRWA) (often referred to as “registered refugees” or “Palestine refugees”), and a further one million <br>refugees who were also displaced in 1948, but are not eligible or did not register for assistance with UNRWA.  <br>The second major group of displaced Palestinians is comprised of those displaced for the ﬁrst time from their <br>homes and country in the context of the 1967 war and their descendants. 1967 Palestinian refugees number <br>approximately 955,247 persons.<br>Internally displaced Palestinians can be divided into two groups. The ﬁrst is composed of persons displaced in the <br>area that became the state of Israel in 1948. This group includes those who were displaced in the 1948 Nakba, <br>(approximately 335,000 persons) as well as those subsequently displaced by the state of Israel. No authoritative <br>data exists for this second category. (See Appendix 1.1 and 2.1) The second group (approximately 129,000 persons) 
<br>is composed of Palestinians internally displaced in the OPT since 1967 as a result of Israel’s occupation, apartheid <br>and colonization of the area. This ﬁgure includes Palestinian refugees who suffered subsequent secondary forced <br>displacement inside the OPT, and whose numbers are estimated to be 37,000 persons at the end of 2008.</p>

<p>* Excluding the 45,800 persons (1948) in Israel who received relief from UNRWA until June 1952. <br>** Including 37,000 persons (2008) who are internally displaced refugees – i.e. refugees displaced at least twice.<br>e ﬁgures above reﬂect estimates according to the best available sources and population growth projections. Figures are therefore indicative <br>rather than conclusive. For more details about these estimates, see Appendix 2.1 at the end of this chapter. </p>
<p>Not included in this estimate is an unknown number</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> of additionally displaced Palestinians who are not 1948 or </p>
<p>1967 refugees, but who have also been displaced outside the area of historical Palestine (Israel and the OPT) and <br>are also likely to qualify as refugees under international law. The majority of the latter have likely been forcibly <br>displaced from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1967 as a result of the policies and practices of <br>Israel’s regime combining occupation, apartheid and colonization. They now reside abroad and are unable or <br>unwilling to return to the OPT or Israel owing to a well-founded fear of persecution. </p>
<p>To avoid double counting, the percentages of IDPs in the OPT excludes internally displaced refugees (37,000 persons).</p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<h7>2.1.1 Data Sources</h7><p>There is no single authoritative source for the global Palestinian refugee and IDP population. Available data on the size <br>of the Palestinian refugee and IDP populations is uneven and shifting, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive <br>registration system, frequent forced displacement, and the lack of a uniform deﬁnition of a Palestinian refugee.</p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>Internal </p>
<p>displacement is also difﬁcult to track because ceaseﬁre lines have changed frequently and there is no internationally <br>recognized border between Israel and the OPT.  </p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has registered 1948 refugees since 1950 and records cover 75 </p>
<p>percent of this group of refugees.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> UNRWA registration data is not statistically valid however, as reporting is voluntary. </p>
<p>UNRWA has never carried out a comprehensive census of all Palestinian refugees under its mandate.  <br>UNRWA  administers  registration  of <br>Palestinian refugees as part of its relief and <br>social services program.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The eligibility and </p>
<p>registration  program  keeps  the  historical <br>refugee  records  maintained  to  determine <br>eligibility  and  registration  for  UNRWA <br>services.  Registration cards are continually <br>updated,  mainly  with  information <br>regarding births, marriages and deaths. By <br>the end of 2008, approximately 42 percent <br>(1,951,603) of UNRWA-registered refugees <br>were  registered  in  Jordan,  23  percent <br>(1,073,303)  in  the  occupied  Gaza  Strip, <br>16 percent (762,820) in the occupied West <br>Bank, 10 percent (461,897) in Syria, and 9 <br>percent (422,188) in Lebanon.</p>
<p>6</p> <p>In general, UNRWA registration records do not include:</p>
<p>1. Refugees displaced in 1948, who: </p>
<p>a.  failed to meet UNRWA’s deﬁnition of “Palestine Refugee”; <br>b. were outside the areas of UNRWA operation (and have not ﬁled for registration under UNRWA’s 1993 </p>
<p>revised eligibility criteria); </p>
<p>c.  were dropped from the records owing to ﬁnancial constraints limiting the number of relief recipients; <br>d. are descendants of refugee mothers and non-refugee fathers;<br>e.  had an independent income or property (and have not ﬁled for registration under UNRWA’s 1993 </p>
<p>revised eligibility criteria);</p>
<p>f.  improved their economic situation to the extent that they no longer met eligibility criteria (prior to the </p>
<p>1993 revision of eligibility criteria); </p>
<p>g.  refused to register for reasons of pride.</p>
<p>2. Palestinians displaced for the ﬁrst time in 1967;<br>3. Palestinians who are not 1948 or 1967 refugees, and are unable (due to revocation of residency, deportation, </p>
<p>etc.) or unwilling (owing to a well-founded fear of persecution) to return to the OPT;</p>
<p>4. IDPs in Israel and the OPT.</p>
<p>In 1952, the  state  of  Israel took responsibility for the task of  assisting  those  Palestinians displaced in  its  territory. <br>UNRWA transferred its IDP registration ﬁles to the government of Israel in June 1952 and has not updated them since.</p>
<p>7</p> <p>In 1982, the UN General Assembly instructed the Secretary-General, in co-operation with the Commissioner General <br>of UNRWA, to issue identiﬁcation cards to all 1948 Palestine refugees and their descendants, irrespective of whether </p>

<p>or not they received rations and services from the Agency, as well as to all 1967 refugees and their descendants.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>initiative failed, however, due to lack of co-operation among host states concerning information on previously non-<br>registered refugees. </p>
<p>Until 1993, refugees wishing to register with UNRWA had to meet requirements of need and initial ﬂight in 1948 <br>into a country where UNRWA operated. Revision of UNRWA’s eligibility and registration criteria in 1993 eliminated <br>these two requirements, which led to the registration of some previously undocumented Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p>In 2006, UNRWA issued new consolidated eligibility and registration instructions. These extend services to the children <br>of registered refugee women married to non-refugees. In 2006, 90,446 such children were enrolled in this new category, <br>mainly in response to the humanitarian crisis in the OPT. They are, however, not registered as refugees in UNRWA’s <br>registration records.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>The  Ofﬁce  of  the  UN  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR)  maintains  records  of  and  statistics  on </p>
<p>Palestinian refugees who fall within the mandate of the Ofﬁce, are outside UNRWA’s area of operations, and are <br>eligible for protection. (See Chapter Three) Registration with UNRWA and UNHCR are not mutually exclusive; i.e., 
<br>Palestinian refugees outside UNRWA’s area of operations may be registered with both. Data reported by UNHCR <br>country  ofﬁces generally reﬂects the view of  the host country, and their statistics are provisional and  subject to <br>change. <br>In general, UNHCR has registered only a very minor portion of the Palestinian refugee population whose number <br>has  been  almost  equal  in  size  to  70  percent  of  the  worldwide  total  number  of  UNHCR  documented  refugees <br>and persons in refugee-like situations in 2007 and 2008. Only 342,681 Palestinian refugees were registered with <br>UNHCR as a population of concern at the end of 2008. At the end of 2007, the number was 343,680. The majority <br>resided in Saudi Arabia (240,025), Egypt (70,174), Iraq (12,302) and Kuwait (6,000).</p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<p>UNHCR data regarding Palestinian  refugees refers to  their country  of origin as  the  “occupied Palestinian </p>
<p>territory.” This classiﬁcation may not reﬂect the actual place of origin, and hence it is not possible to identify <br>how many Palestinian refugees of concern to the UNHCR are 1948 refugees, 1967 refugees, or Palestinians <br>displaced from former Palestine after 1967. Palestinian IDPs in Israel and the OPT are not included in the </p>
<p>UNHCR data regarding IDPs worldwide.</p>
<p>Census  data  and  population  growth </p>
<p>projections  represent  an  additional </p>
<p>source  of  estimates  of  the  Palestinian <br>refugee  and  IDP  populations.  The <br>Palestinian  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics <br>(PCBS)  has  conducted  two  population <br>censuses in 1997 and 2007 which include <br>refugees as a category, as well as questions <br>regarding  ongoing  forced  displacement. <br>PCBS  however,  only  has  access  to  the <br>Palestinian  population  in  the  OPT. <br>The  Israel  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics </p>
<p>publishes  little  statistical  data  about </p>
<p>Israel’s  Palestinians  citizens  and  does <br>not  keep  separate  records  on  internally </p>
<p>displaced Palestinians.</p>
<p>11 </p>
<p>Few host countries carry out a regular  census of their resident refugee  population, </p>
<p>and  some  do  not  include  Palestinian  refugees  as  a  category  of  refugees.  Some  countries,  such  as  Jordan, <br>include Palestinians as a census category, but this data is not publicly available. In North America and Europe, </p>
<p>Palestinian asylum-seekers are often included in a general category of “stateless” persons, or classiﬁed according <br>to their place of birth, or the host country that issued their travel documents.</p>
<h5>2.2 Distribution</h5>
<p>During the major waves of displacement in the 20</p>
<p>th</p>
<p> century, Palestinian refugees tended to remain as close as </p>
<p>possible to their homes and villages of origin, based on the assumption that they would return once armed <br>conﬂict ceased. In 1948, an estimated 65 percent of the Palestinian refugees remained in areas of Palestine not <br>under Israeli control – i.e., the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which comprised 22 percent of the territory of <br>Mandate Palestine. In the West Bank, the Palestinian population swelled from 460,000 to 740,000 due to the <br>mass inﬂux of refugees at that time. <br>The impact of mass inﬂux into the areas of the former Gaza District that became known as the Gaza Strip was <br>even more dramatic. The population nearly quadrupled. The remaining 35 percent of the Palestinian refugee <br>population found refuge in neighboring states, including Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. An unknown <br>number of Palestinian Arab citizens were abroad at the time of the 1948 Nakba in Palestine, and were unable 
<br>to return to their places of origin inside Israel following the cessation of hostilities; they became refugees sur 
</p>
<p>place. </p>
<p>The majority of Palestinian IDPs in Israel were displaced in 1948 in the north and the center of the country <br>(85.5  percent  of  the  total  Palestinian  population  of  the  north  at  the  time,  75.1  percent  of  the  center’s <br>population). A smaller number were displaced between 1949 and 1967 (7.1 percent of the population in <br>the north and 18.1 percent in the center). These IDPs found refuge in some 47 Palestinian Arab villages that <br>remained within the state of Israel after the 1948 war.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Palestinians in the south of the country were mainly </p>
<p>displaced after 1967 (77.2 percent).</p>

<p>Most Palestinian IDPs in Israel are currently concentrated in the northern (Galilee) region of the country, including Palestinian <br>cities such as Nazareth and Shafa’amr, and in cities with a mixed Jewish-Arab population, such as Haifa and Akka (Acre). IDPs <br>are also located in the south (Naqab). The actual distribution of IDPs inside Israel is difﬁcult to determine due to the lack of a <br>registration system and frequent relocation (three to four times on average per family). <br>The majority of Palestinians displaced from the OPT during the 1967 war found refuge in neighboring states. Most (95 <br>percent) were displaced to Jordan, with smaller numbers displaced to Syria, Egypt and Lebanon.</p>

<p>closest to Jordan suffered the highest population loss, while in the central highlands most Palestinians sought temporary refuge <br>in nearby ﬁelds and villages, and were able to return to their homes after the war.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> In addition, it is estimated that some 60,000 </p>
<p>Palestinians were abroad at the time of the war and were unable to return to the OPT.</p>
<p>16</p> <p>The  distribution  of  Palestinians  displaced  from  and  within  the  OPT  since  1967,  including  those  displaced  for  the  ﬁrst <br>time, is difﬁcult to determine given the lack of a registration system and frequent displacement over four decades of military <br>occupation. <br>Changes in the pattern of  distribution of Palestinian refugees across host  countries during  six decades of  forced exile  are <br>primarily the result of armed conﬂicts after 1948 and 1967, during which Palestinian refugees were again expelled or forced to <br>ﬂee host countries in search of safety. Changes in political regimes and discriminatory policies in host countries, the relationship <br>between the PLO and host country authorities, and economic push-and-pull factors have also inﬂuenced patterns of forced <br>displacement and distribution of the Palestinian refugee population since 1948. (See Chapter One)
<br>The 1967 war and subsequent Israeli occupation led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of refugees residing in the West <br>Bank and Gaza Strip, and to a dramatic increase in the refugee population in Jordan after 1967. Over time, the number of <br>Palestinian refugees in Lebanon has decreased due to internal conﬂict, conﬂict between the PLO and Israel in Lebanon, and <br>legal and political obstacles that have militated against Palestinian refugees’ temporary asylum in Lebanon. During the 1980s, <br>many Palestinian refugees ﬂed Lebanon to Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.<br>Higher numbers of Palestinian refugees in the Gulf from the 1950s onward reﬂect patterns of economic migration, while a <br>dramatic decrease in the number of refugees in Kuwait occurred as a result of the 1991 Gulf War. Many Palestinians migrated <br>or were expelled from Gulf States, eventually ﬁnding shelter in Canada, Scandinavia, the United States, or other countries in <br>the Arab world. Currently, many of the Palestinian refugees experiencing persecution in Iraq are ﬂeeing to Syria, Jordan and <br>other countries, with some reported as far as India and Thailand. </p>

<p>Today, Palestinian refugees are living in forced exile in many parts of the world. Despite the changes in the pattern <br>of distribution of Palestinian refugees over the last 60 years, the majority of refugees still live within 100 km of the <br>borders of Israel and the 1967 OPT, where their homes of origin are located. In Syria, for example, 70 percent of <br>the registered 1948 refugees are from the Galilee. The number is slightly higher in Lebanon, where 72 percent of <br>the registered 1948 refugees are from the Galilee. </p>
<p>Similarly, a large majority of the refugees in the occupied Gaza Strip originate from the adjacent areas of the former <br>Gaza District. The majority of the refugees from the former Jerusalem District are at present either in the occupied <br>West Bank or in Jordan. The proportion of Palestinian refugees (6 percent) within the total combined population of <br>host states in the region has remained stable since the ﬁrst wave of massive displacement in 1948.</p>

<p>Khan Younis, Majdal, Isdud, Beersheba); Lydd (Jaﬀa, Ramle, Lod, Rechovot); Samaria (Tulkarem, Nablus, Jenin, Natanya); Haifa (Haifa, Hadera, <br>Shafa ‘Amr); Galilee (Nazareth, Beisan, Tiberias, Acre, Safad). </p>
<p>Despite the passing of more than 60 years in exile, the village unit has tended to remain intact to some degree, even after <br>mass displacement. In other words, the majority of the residents of a particular village tended to be displaced to the same <br>host country, and often to the same area within the host country. According to data for Palestinian refugees registered <br>with UNRWA, 72 percent of all 1948 displaced Palestinian villages found refuge in one area, with only 20 percent ﬂeeing <br>to two areas. Only eight percent are distributed between more than two areas.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Distribution according to village of </p>
<p>origin is evident in the structure of Palestinian refugee camps, which are divided into quarters based on the village unit. <br>In Syria, for example, al-Yarmouk camp is divided into quarters based on the refugee villages of origin of al-Tira, Lubya, <br>Balad ash-Sheik, and ‘Ayn Ghazal. </p>
<p>The same phenomenon is also evident in those Palestinian villages inside Israel that provided refuge for internally <br>displaced Palestinians in 1948. In many villages, neighborhoods are named for the origin of the displaced persons <br>who reside in them. The Palestinian village of ‘Arrabeh, for example, includes the neighborhood of the Mi’aris (i.e., <br>displaced persons originating from the village of Mi’ar). Likewise, displaced persons from al-Birwa who took shelter <br>in the village of al-Judeideh live in the Birwani neighborhood.</p>
<h7>2.2.1 Refugees in Camps</h7><p>19</p>
<p>According to UNRWA records, 1,373,732 Palestinian refugees were registered in UNRWA’s 58 ofﬁcial refugee <br>camps throughout the OPT, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria by the end of 2008. Registered refugees in camps comprise <br>29.4 percent of the total UNRWA registered refugee population and 20.7 percent of the total Palestinian refugee <br>population. In addition, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees reside in one of at least 17 unofﬁcial camps <br>in the OPT, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The majority of Palestinian refugees registered in camps are 1948 refugees, <br>including their descendants. </p>

<p>Not all Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA living in camps physically reside in an ofﬁcial refugee camp. <br>Several factors explain why Palestinian refugees have remained in or maintained ties with the camps after more <br>than six decades of exile:</p>
<p>family and village support structure in the camp; <br>lack of resources to rent or buy alternative accommodation outside the camp; 
<br>lack of living space outside the camp due to overcrowding; 
<br>legal, political and social obstacles that force refugees to remain in the camp; 
<br>issues concerning physical safety;
<br>The refugee camp as a symbol of the temporary nature of exile and the demand to exercise the right of 
<br>return.</p>
<p>The largest camp population resides in the occupied Gaza Strip (495,006 or 46% of UNRWA registered refugees <br>in Gaza, end of 2008), comprising about 36 percent of all camp-registered refugees. In the occupied West Bank, <br>there are fewer refugees in camps (193,370, end of 2008). Approximately 38 percent of all UNRWA registered <br>refugees in the OPT reside in camps. <br>The second-highest number of camp refugees is found in Jordan (338,000 end 2008). However, Jordan is also </p>
<p>the host country with the lowest percentage of refugees in camps: only 17.3 percent of the UNRWA registered <br>Palestinian refugees in Jordan reside in camps. This reﬂects the status afforded to most Palestinian refugees in Jordan </p>
<p>as Jordanian citizens. </p>



<p>66</p>
<h7>Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (2008-2009)</h7>

<p>Lebanon and Syria are the host countries with the largest portion of camp refugees. In Lebanon, approximately 53 <br>percent (222,776, end of 2008) live in ofﬁcial camps. The high percentage of camp refugees in Lebanon is directly <br>related to the restrictions placed on freedom of movement by the Lebanese government, the lack of resources for <br>alternative housing outside of the camps, and concerns about physical safety. In Syria, where approximately 59.3 <br>percent are camp refugees, more Palestinian refugees live in unofﬁcial camps (147,147) than in ofﬁcial camps <br>(125,009), because some unofﬁcial camps, in particular Yarmouk, are located close to the capital Damascus and <br>offer good services.</p>

<p>a. During the 1970s, the Israeli military administration destroyed thousands of refugee shelters in the occupied Gaza Strip under security pretexts. </p>
<p>Large refugee camps were targeted in particular. Refugees were forcibly resettled in other areas of the occupied Gaza Strip, with a smaller number <br>transferred to the occupied West Bank. In the occupied Gaza Strip, several housing projects were established for these refugees. Some of these projects <br>today are referred to as camps. ese include the Canada project (1972), the Shuqairi project (1973), the Brazil project (1973), the Sheikh <br>Radwan project (1974), and the al-Amal project (1979). </p>
<p>b. ere are more than 4,220 ex-Gaza refugees distributed throughout West Bank camps.<br>c. An additional 4,000 Palestinians are estimated by UNRWA to be living in  the camp as a result of Israel’s policy of residency revocation in 
</p>

<p>Demographic and socio-economic  indicators  reﬂect the vulnerability of internally displaced Palestinians and <br>refugees during six decades of displacement. Lack of personal security and socio-economic wellbeing and stability <br>are the result of Israel’s policies and practices of occupation, apartheid and colonization and a series of armed <br>conﬂicts in the region,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> in particular where refugee-hood is compounded with statelessness, ineffective protection </p>
<p>and insufﬁcient assistance.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Due  to  lack  of  registration  and  documentation,  no  statistical  data  is  available  on  the  demographic  and <br>socioeconomic characteristics of Palestinian refugee populations outside UNRWA’s area of operation, and little <br>reliable data is available on the characteristics of internally displaced Palestinians in Israel and the OPT. Such data <br>is available almost exclusively for the population of UNRWA registered 1948 refugees, who constitute 66 percent <br>of all displaced Palestinians.</p>
<h7>2.3.1 Demographic Indicators</h7><p>Differences between the Palestinian refugee populations and the local non-refugee populations are negligible in <br>most Arab host states, with Lebanon constituting the only major exception.</p>
<p>24</p> <p>The Palestinian refugee population is young. Approximately <br>31  percent  of  all  registered  refugees  are  below  the  age  of <br>ﬁfteen. 38 percent are less than 18 years old. The occupied <br>Gaza Strip has the youngest refugee population: 46.4 percent <br>are less than 18 years old and 13.7 percent are aged 0-4 years. <br>The  percentage  of  young  Palestinian  refugees  is  lowest  in <br>Lebanon, where those under 18 make up 28.5 percent of the <br>registered refugee population, while 6.4 percent are aged 0-4 <br>years. The large share of children and youth gives rise to high <br>dependency ratios, a large burden on the refugee labor force, <br>and a strong need for health and education services.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Refugees  have  a  high  fertility  rate  (calculated  as  the <br>average  number  of  children  per  woman),  but  there  has <br>been  a  consistent  decline  in  the  fertility  rate  among <br>Palestinian  refugees,  in  particular  in  the  occupied  West <br>Bank (from 6.17 in 1983-1994 to 4.2 in 2006), Jordan <br>(from 6.2 in 1983-1986 to 4.6 in 2000), Lebanon (from <br>4.49 in 1991 to 2.3 in 2006) and Syria (from 3.8 in 2000 <br>to 2.4 in 2006). In the occupied Gaza Strip, the fertility <br>rate  increased  between  1983  and  1994  (from  7.15  to <br>7.69), followed by a slow decrease from 2000 onwards.</p>
<p>26 </p>
<p>Declining  fertility  rates  are  the  result  of  later  marriage, <br>more female enrollment in higher education, increased use <br>of contraceptives, and a slight rise in the participation rate <br>of women in the labor force.</p>
<p>No data is available about the age structure and other demographic indicators of Palestinian IDPs. However, as differences <br>between refugee and non-refugee populations in major Arab host states are negligible, the age structure and fertility rate <br>of Palestinian IDPs are likely to be similar to the general Palestinian population in Israel and in the OPT.</p>

<h11>Figure 2.5: Population Pyramid, UNRWA Registered Palestinian Refugees, 2008</h11> <p>Source: UNRWA website, accessed 20 March 2009</p>
<p>The mortality rate of the Palestinian population in the OPT is relatively low similar to that in Western countries <br>in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> Infant and child mortality rates of the refugee population have declined over the past six </p>
<p>decades. Infant mortality rates among refugees, for example, declined from around 200 per 1,000 births in 1950, <br>to around 24 per 1,000 births in the OPT in 2006, and eight per 1,000 births in Israel in 2003.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Mortality rates </p>
<p>of refugee infants and children under ﬁve have remained highest in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria.  <br>In the  OPT,  infant  and  child  mortality  rates  were  slightly  higher  among  refugees  (27.5  and  32.3  per  1000 <br>respectively) than among the general Palestinian population (24.2 and 28.3 per 1000 respectively) in the period <br>of 1999 – 2003. </p>

<p>The Palestinian  refugee and IDP population  has  a high, albeit declining,  growth rate. This is similar to  the <br>Palestinian population as a whole, which has roughly doubled every twenty years. The average annual growth rate <br>of the UNRWA-registered refugee population for the period 1955 – 2008 is 3.3 percent according to the agency’s <br>records, while according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the average annual growth rate of the <br>entire Palestinian population was 3.5 percent for 1949 – 1999, and 3 percent for 2000 – 2008.</p>

<p>30</p>
<p> indicate the level of economic wellbeing of populations. </p>
<p>High rates of labor force participation and low unemployment are indicators of a healthy economy that provides a <br>good quality of life for the population. Low levels of participation in the labor force and high unemployment are </p>
<p>related to low income levels, high poverty rates and unhealthy living conditions.</p>
<p>In early 2009, shortly after the end of Israel’s military assault on the Gaza Strip, Palestinian refugee households ranked their top-10 </p>
<p>needs and concerns: economic security (86%); employment (60%; 66% men and 54% women); personal safety and security (59%); </p>
<p>family (45%; 49% women and 41% men); politics (43%); education (39%; 43% women and 36% men); health (35%; 60% in the <br>55+ age group); marriage (10%; 13% men and 7% women); emigration (10%; 14% men and 6% women); and, recreation (5%).</p>

<p>“Evidence from a Household Sample Survey.”</p>
<p>Less than half of the total Palestinian refugee and IDP labor force in major hosting countries including Israel and <br>the OPT, is economically active. In 2008, labor force participation was highest among refugees in Syria (49.3%) <br>and lowest in the occupied Gaza Strip (37.5 percent).  </p>

<p>Labour force participation among refugee women is very low compared to refugee men. Participation generally increases <br>with higher education, especially among women. Research published in 2003 shows that young refugee women aged 15 to <br>24 in Lebanon and Jordan identiﬁed family duties (44</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> and 43</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> respectively) and study (30</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>41</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> respectively) as the most important reasons for economic inactivity; among older women, family duties were </p>
<p>given as the single most important reason (varying between 66</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> and 86</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> among women over 25 years old). </p>
<p>Academic study was given as the most signiﬁcant reason for economic inactivity among young men (15–24 years old), while <br>discouragement was the most commonly cited reason by young adult men (25 - 45 years old). Older men cited health reasons <br>and retirement as the principal reasons for economic inactivity.</p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<p>Unemployment rates among the  Palestinian refugee population range  between 11 percent and 43.1  percent, <br>with the highest rates found in the occupied Gaza Strip. In 2008, the unemployment rate among refugees in the <br>Gaza Strip was 38.3 percent for males and 43.1 percent for females, compared with 20.5 percent for males in the <br>West Bank and 17 percent for females. High unemployment rates among refugees are problematic, in particular <br>because refugees usually have little alternative sources of income. In the OPT, moreover, high unemployment <br>among refugees has a negative impact on the wellbeing of the entire population, as refugees constitute a signiﬁcant <br>portion of the total population (45 percent) of the OPT (32 percent in WB and 68 percent in GS).<br>No  disaggregate  data  is  available  about  the  socio-economic  characteristics  of  Palestinian  IDPs  in  Israel  and <br>the OPT. For IDPs in Israel, data pertaining to the general Palestinian population serves as an indicator: the <br>unemployment rate among the total Palestinian labor force in Israel is 10.1 percent (13.5 percent for females and <br>9.1 percent for males).</p>
<p>32</p>
<h7>2.3.3 Poverty and Food Insecurity</h7><p>Annual per capita income among Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the OPT ranges from US <br>$450 to US $600. Household incomes are higher among refugees in the OPT than elsewhere, and lowest among <br>refugees in Syria.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> According to UNRWA estimates at the end of 2007, approximately 12 percent of refugee </p>
<p>households in Lebanon suffer deep poverty compared with 3 percent in Jordan and 7 percent in Syria.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>In the  OPT,  the  per  capita  income  declined  by  40  percent  between  1999  and  2007,</p>
<p>35 </p>
<p>and  impoverishment </p>
<p>of the  Palestinian population continues.  By 2007, approximately 30.3 percent of Palestinian households had <br>consumption levels below the poverty line although they were receiving assistance.</p>
<p>36 </p>
<p>57.2 percent of households </p>
<p>had a level of income that indicates poverty, whereas 46.3 percent of households had income levels that indicate <br>deep poverty (34 percent in the West Bank and 69.9 percent in Gaza Strip). <br>Food  aid  has  become  increasingly <br>signiﬁcant as food sources from agricultural <br>areas in the occupied West Bank (Qalqilya, <br>Tulkarem, and the Jordan Valley) and the <br>Gaza Strip have  been affected by  Israel’s <br>indiscriminate and excessive use of force <br>during military operations and the policy <br>of  closure  and  segregation.  From  2000 <br>to  2007,  for  example,  Israel  destroyed <br>2,851  dunums of  land,  13,147  dunums <br>of  vegetables  and  14,076  dunums  of <br>Palestinian ﬁeld crops.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Over the course </p>
<p>of  the  past  ﬁve  years,  Israel  destroyed <br>455  wells,  37,929  dunums  of  irrigation <br>network, 1,000 km of main pipelines, 1.9 <br>km of irrigation pools, 930 agricultural stores and 1,862 of animal barns and stables. In the same period 1.6 <br>million Palestinian trees were uprooted, further jeopardizing Palestinian food production. In early 2007, food <br>insecurity and vulnerability were about 40 percent and 12 percent respectively among refugees in the OPT.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>The refugee population living in camps had the least food security, which also indicates that food insecurity was <br>highest in the Gaza Strip. <br>In the  OPT,  households in refugee camps suffer  from the  highest rates of  poverty as measured according to <br>consumption patterns. Approximately 39 percent of camp households are poor compared with 29.5 percent of <br>urban and rural households. Application of a poverty index also showed that the situation is worse for refugee </p>

<p>76</p>
<h7>Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (2008-2009)</h7>

<p>households (33.3%) as compared with non-refugee households (29.1 percent).</p>
<p>39 </p>
<p>This can be explained by the </p>
<p>higher  unemployment  rates,  the  high  dependency  ratio  and  the  big  size  of  refugee  camp  households  when <br>compared with urban and rural households. Another explanation is provided by the higher poverty level in the <br>Gaza Strip where the majority of the population is composed of refugees and camp populations.<br>In early 2009, 63 percent of Palestinian households interviewed in the Gaza Strip stated that their economic <br>situation  had  deteriorated  as  a  result  of  Israel’s  most  recent  military  operation.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>  60  percent  of  Palestinian </p>
<p>households were in need of assistance and 25 percent were in need of psycho-social support. The most pressing <br>needs identiﬁed by these households were cash assistance (39 percent), cooking gas (20 percent), house repair (16 <br>percent), and food (12 percent).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>In Israel, all 76 Palestinian local authorities are ranked in the lower half of the national socio-economic development <br>scale, with 85 percent of the localities placed in the lowest three deciles.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> 53 percent of Palestinian families in </p>
<p>Israel live below the poverty line, as do 400,000 out of 775,000 Arab children.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> The most vulnerable group were </p>
<p>Palestinian Bedouin, most of whom are IDPs living in localities that are not recognized by the Israeli authorities. <br>Approximately 80 percent of this group</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> lives below the poverty line.  </p>
<h7>2.3.4 Housing </h7><p>Sub-standard  housing  is  an  indicator  of  lack  of  development.  It  is  also  linked  to  poor  health  and  has  a <br>disproportionately severe impact on women and other caregivers, children, handicapped people, and the elderly.</p>
<p>45</p> <p>Overall, housing conditions  for  Palestinian refugees are best in Syria and Jordan, followed by the  OPT  and <br>Lebanon. However, within these geographical areas, housing conditions differ widely. <br>Housing problems tend to be more pronounced in camps. Nevertheless, as a result of international assistance, <br>refugee camps often have better infrastructure than areas outside camps. While the area of refugee camps has <br>generally remained the same over the last 60 years, their population has more than quadrupled. In areas where </p>

<p>77</p>
<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<p>construction is permitted, this has led to vertical expansion of the camps. In some areas, including Lebanon, the <br>government has prohibited construction in the camps. <br>According to ﬁndings from 2004, Palestinian refugee homes comprise an average of three rooms. Average housing <br>capacity is lowest in Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> The primary infrastructural problem facing all refugee households is </p>
<p>access to safe and secure supplies of drinking water, in particular in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.</p>
<p>47 </p> <p>By  2007,  the  average  number  of  rooms <br>in  a  Palestinian  housing  unit  in  Israel <br>was 4.3 and the housing density was 1.13 <br>persons per room. </p>
<p>Palestinian households </p>
<p>in  Israel,  including  IDP  households, <br>suffer from a shortage of land designated <br>for  development.  Some  19  percent  of <br>Palestinian households have suffered from <br>land conﬁscation between 1947 and 2007, <br>while 10.8 percent of households have had <br>their homes demolished or conﬁscated by <br>the  Israeli  government  during  the  same <br>period.  58.4  percent  of  the  households <br>stated that they  would need at least  one <br>new  housing  unit  in  the  next  ten  years, <br>and  34.1  percent  said  they  would  need <br>at least two. This, while 66.8  percent of <br>these households said they were unable to <br>build the needed housing unit/s.</p>

<p>The international standard for overcrowding is three or more persons per room. Overcrowding is related to lack <br>of resources with which to expand existing shelters or build new ones, planning and  building restrictions, and <br>household size. Overcrowding is most severe in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, where one in three households </p>

<p>78</p>
<h7>Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (2008-2009)</h7>

<p>experiences overcrowding. In the OPT, Syria and Lebanon, <br>overcrowding  is  slightly  less  of  a  problem. There  are  no <br>signiﬁcant  differences  in  crowding  between  non-refugee <br>households and refugee households outside camps in Jordan <br>and  in  the  OPT.  Refugee  households  outside  camps  in <br>Lebanon, however, are more overcrowded than households <br>of Lebanese nationals. </p>
<h7>2.3.5 Education</h7><p>Education is highly valued in the face of the protracted nature <br>of the Palestinian refugee crisis. It is seen both as offering an <br>opportunity for a better life and as a means of reafﬁrming </p>
<p>identity. A study commissioned by UNRWA on adolescents’ </p>
<p>knowledge  of  and  attitudes  towards  family,  reproductive <br>health issues and lifestyle practices, showed that 76 percent <br>of respondents aspired to higher education.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> Most refugees </p>
<p>beneﬁt from elementary and preparatory education provided <br>by  UNRWA  schools,  while  others  study  in  host  country <br>public  schools.  Few  study  in  private  schools.  Access  to <br>secondary  and  higher  education  is  restricted  in  some  host <br>countries. Financial constraints prevent other refugees from <br>continuing education. (See Chapter Four)
</p>
<p>Education-related problems for refugees differ among host countries, and include inadequate education among <br>young men in camps in Jordan, a signiﬁcant number of young adults in Syria who lack basic education, and high <br>levels of illiteracy overall.</p>
<p>50 </p>
<p>During the civil war and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the 1980s, some refugee children lost more than a year <br>of schooling. In the OPT, refugee children lost between 35 percent and 50 percent of class time during the ﬁrst </p>
<p>Intifada. The second Intifada has also negatively affected access to education and the quality of education provided </p>
<p>in the OPT.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> Israeli military and Jewish settler activity in the OPT has had a negative effect on the capacity of </p>
<p>students to concentrate, participate in class, and meet amongst themselves for study purposes.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> During 2006, a </p>
<p>decline was observed in test scores in schools and school attendance in the OPT.</p>

<p>Enrollment  rates  among  Palestinian </p>
<p>refugee and IDP children are high in all </p>
<p>areas/host countries at the elementary <br>and  preparatory  stages,  whereas  the </p>
<p>rates  decline  at  the  secondary  and </p>
<p>higher education stages. <br>Nearly  all  refugee  children  are <br>enrolled  at  the  elementary  stage, <br>and  no  statistical  differences  exist <br>between male and female enrolment <br>at  the  elementary  and  preparatory <br>stages.  Female  enrolment  is  higher <br>than  male  enrolment  in  secondary <br>and  higher  education  (with  the <br>exception  of  Jordan).  In  Lebanon, <br>fewer Palestinian refugees are enrolled <br>in  secondary  and  higher  education <br>than elsewhere. </p>

<p>The average illiteracy rate among Palestinians aged 15 years and over was 25.5 percent in Lebanon (2006), 17.6 <br>percent in the refugee camps in Jordan (2000), 16.5 percent in Syria (2006); 5.7 percent in the OPT (2007) and <br>4.9 percent among Palestinians in Israel.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Illiteracy rates have been declining in all countries and areas. Among young age groups, the illiteracy rate has <br>remained the highest in Lebanon. In the OPT and in Israel, more Palestinian women than men are illiterate, a <br>phenomena which exists in younger age groups as well. However there is more illiteracy in Arab host states among <br>young men than women.</p>

<h7>Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (2008-2009)</h7>

<h7>2.3.6 Health  </h7><p>The health status of Palestinian refugees is in transition from <br>a developing to a developed stage. The health of women and <br>children has improved dramatically over the course of the <br>last ﬁve decades. The best reported health outcomes are in <br>the OPT, Jordan and Syria. <br>Armed  conﬂict,  ineffective  protection,  and  insufﬁcient <br>assistance leave refugees in Lebanon the most vulnerable to <br>health problems. Between 30,000 and 40,000 Palestinians <br>were killed in the 1970s and 1980s during the civil war and <br>Israeli invasions in Lebanon. In the OPT, public health is at <br>risk due to policies and practices of the Israeli occupation. <br>At least  39,000 Palestinians  have been injured and 6,322 <br>killed in the current Intifada since 29 September  2000.
</p>
<p>55</p> <p>By 2006, around 42 percent of households affected by the <br>Wall in the occupied West Bank were separated from health <br>services  (hospitals  and  medical  centers).  Impeded  access <br>to medical care was particularly acute in the closed zones <br>between the Wall and the Green Line, where 79 percent of <br>families are separated from health centers and hospitals.</p>
<p>56</p> <p>66 percent of chronically ill persons in the occupied Gaza Strip were in need of medical care during Israel’s 2008/9 military </p>
<p>operation “Cast Lead.” Of those, 53 percent received adequate health care, 27 percent received inadequate care, and 20 percent </p>
<p>did not receive any health care. 30 percent of those who did not receive care, did not do so because it was too dangerous to <br>try to reach health facilities and hospitals.</p>

<p>Miscarriages in Gaza during Israel’s 2008/9 Military Assault</p>
<p>A report by UNFPA indicated that miscarriages increased by 40 percent during Israel’s war on Gaza. The report also pointed <br>to an increase in caesarean sections at the al Shifa Hospital, Gaza, during the war, standing at 32 percent in December 2008 <br>and 29 percent in January 2009 of total deliveries during these months. According to the Palestinian Family Health Survey of <br>2006, the average rate of caesarean sections in normal situations was 15 percent. The report also pointed out an increase in <br>the number of births in January 2009 registering an increase of 1000 births - 5000 births in January 2009 compared to 4000 <br>monthly births per month before the war. The increase in births is largely as a result of the increase in premature births. </p>
<h9>2.3.6.1 Women’s and Children’s Health </h9><p>In general, Palestinian refugee women, including those in camps, have good health indicators. Nearly all refugee <br>women visit health centers during pregnancy, and most of them receive qualiﬁed birth assistance. (See Chapter 
</p>
<p>Four) </p>
<p>By 2000, there were no signiﬁcant differences between maternal health care and delivery assistance available to <br>women inside or outside camps.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Prenatal care was generally higher among refugees than host country nationals, </p>
<p>except in Lebanon, where nationals are more likely to have assistance with deliveries than Palestinian refugees. <br>Maternal mortality rates were highest in Lebanon and lowest in Syria.</p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<p>Low birth weight is not a signiﬁcant problem among refugees. (The international standard for low birth weight is less <br>than 2,500 grams.) There are no signiﬁcant differences in birth weights between camp and non-camp refugee children. In <br>Jordan and Lebanon, low birth weight is more frequent among host country nationals than among refugees. <br>Standard vaccination programs are well implemented, although rates are lower among Palestinian refugees in Syria and <br>Lebanon than for host country nationals.</p>
<p>58</p> <p>Infant mortality rates are also low despite a stagnation of the infant mortality rate in the OPT.</p>
<p>59 </p>
<p>Palestinian refugees in </p>
<p>Syria have particularly low infant mortality rates, while these rates are highest in Lebanon. Infant mortality rates are higher <br>among host country nationals than Palestinian refugees in Syria and Jordan. </p>
<p>Childhood malnutrition has not been a signiﬁcant problem, although increasing levels of child malnutrition <br>in the OPT give grounds for concern: 10 percent of Palestinian children there were malnourished in 2006, <br>with children in the occupied Gaza Strip particularly affected.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> In 2005, signs were reported of a resurgence </p>
<p>of anemia, affecting 55 percent and 34 percent of children under the age of three in the occupied Gaza Strip <br>and West Bank respectively, as well as micronutrient deﬁciencies, with 22 percent of children under the age <br>of ﬁve suffering from Vitamin A deﬁciency.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> Acute malnutrition presents more of a problem in camps in </p>
<p>Lebanon and Syria than in Jordan. <br>Rates of chronic illness in camps are higher among refugee boys than refugee girls, and higher than for <br>refugee children outside camps. Palestinian refugee children in Lebanon have the highest rates of chronic <br>illness and disability. </p>

<h7>Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (2008-2009)</h7>

<h4>Appendix 2.1 </h4>
<h7>Notes regarding estimates of Palestinian displacement, including Table 2.1</h7><p>Comparison with earlier estimates </p>
<p>In the 2006-2007 Survey, Badil estimated that 7.4 million Palestinians were forcibly displaced persons by mid-<br>2007, including 7 million refugees and 450,000 IDPs. Badil’s updated estimate for the end of 2008 is 7.1 million <br>displaced Palestinians, including 6.6 million refugees and 427,000 IDPs. The 2008 estimates were calculated <br>based on the methodology adopted previously, as well as the ﬁndings of the population census conducted in the <br>OPT in 2007 by the PCBS. (See below) 
</p>
<p>1948 UNRWA-registered refugees</p>
<p>UNRWA reported 4.7 million registered refugees as of 31 December 2008. UNRWA ﬁgures are based on data <br>voluntarily supplied by registered refugees. UNRWA registration statistics do not claim to be and should not <br>be taken as statistically valid demographic data. This information is collected by UNRWA for its own internal <br>management purposes, and to facilitate certiﬁcation of refugee eligibility to receive education, health, and relief <br>and social services. New information on births, marriages, deaths, and change in place of residence is recorded <br>only when a refugee requests the updating of the family registration card issued by the Agency. UNRWA does <br>not carry out a census, house-to-house survey, or any other means of verifying place of residence. Refugees will <br>normally report births, deaths, and marriages when they seek a service from the Agency. Births, for instance, are <br>reported if the family makes use of UNRWA maternity and child health services, or when the child reaches school <br>age if admission is sought to an UNRWA school, or even later if neither of these services is needed. Deaths tend to <br>remain under-reported. While families are encouraged to have a separate registration card for each nuclear family <br>(parents and children), this is not obligatory. Family size information may therefore include a mix of nuclear and <br>extended families, in some cases including as many as four generations.</p>
<p>1948 non-registered refugees </p>
<p>The number of persons in this group is calculated as being one third of the total registered refugee population <br>based on the assumption that “UNRWA registered refugees represent approximately three-quarters of Palestinian <br>refugees worldwide.” </p>
<p>See Annual Growth rate of registered Palestine refugees and female percentage, 1953–2000: http://</p>
<p>www.un.org/unrwa/publicatons/index.html. This  assumption  was  applied  to the calculation for the three  regions: <br>Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. As for the OPT, the results of the 1997 and 2007 PCBS censuses revealed that non-<br>registered 1948 refugees represent 1.6 percent of the total population in the OPT (accessed 5 February 2009). Thus <br>the total number of 1948 non-registered refugees at the end of 2008 is 1,014,741.</p>
<p>Estimates of the 1948 Palestinian refugee population</p>
<p>The total number of 1948 refugees is calculated by combining UNRWA-registered refugees and non-registered <br>refugees as described above; it amounts to 5,686,552 at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>Alternative estimates: Based on The Palestinian Nakba 1948: The Register of Depopulated Localities in Palestine, </p>
<p>London: The Palestinian Return Center, 1998; this source assumes an average annual growth rate of 3.5</p>
<p> percent</p> <p>for the Palestinian  refugee  population  based  on British demographic  data  from  1947.  Accordingly,  the  total <br>number of estimated 1948 refugees at the end of 2008 is 6,723,439. If an adjusted annual growth of 3</p>
<p> percent</p> <p>is applied from 2000 onwards – giving proper consideration to the decline of the fertility rate and the annual </p>

<h7>POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS</h7>

<p>growth rate - the total number of 1948 refugees (registered and non-registered) amounts to 6,467,947 by the end <br>of 2008.</p>
<p>1967 Palestinian refugees</p>
<p>Figures are derived from The Report of the Secretary-General under General Assembly Resolution 2252 (EX-V) and </p>
<p>Security Council Resolution 237 (1967), UN Doc. A/6797, 15 September 1967 and the average annual growth rate </p>
<p>of the Palestinian population (3.5</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> for 1967-1999 and 3.0</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> for 2000-2008). </p>
<p>This ﬁgure includes only persons who were externally displaced for the ﬁrst time in 1967. It does not include internally </p>
<p>displaced persons and 1948 refugees displaced for a second time in 1967. See also Takkenberg, Lex, The Status of </p>
<p>Palestinian  Refugees  in  International  Law,  Oxford: Clarendon  Press Oxford, 1998, p.  17;  approximately  193,500 </p>
<p>Palestinian refugees were displaced for a second time, while 240,000 non-refugees were displaced for the ﬁrst time, </p>
<p>bringing the total to over 430,000 persons displaced in 1967. The ﬁgure also excludes those refugees who returned </p>
<p>under  a  limited  repatriation  program  between  August  and  September  1967.  The  ﬁgure  does  not  account  for </p>
<p>Palestinians who were abroad at the time of the 1967 war and unable to return, refugees reuniﬁed with family inside <br>the OPT, or those refugees who returned after 1994 under the agreements of the Oslo peace process. </p>
<p>Palestinian IDPs in Israel since 1948</p> <p>According to Hillel Cohen, the author of a study on displaced Palestinians in Israel, and as stated by the National <br>Committee for the Rights of the Internally Displaced in Israel: “[O]f the estimated 150,000 Palestinians who <br>remained in Israel proper when the last armistice agreement was signed in 1949, some 46,000 were internally <br>displaced, as per UNRWA’s 1950 registry record.” Data for 2008 was calculated on the basis of an estimated <br>average annual growth rate of the Palestinian population inside Israel of 3.5</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> for the period 1949-1999, </p>
<p>and 3.0</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> for 2000-2008.</p>
<p>No reliable data exist on internal displacement of Palestinians in Israel after 1948 as a consequence of internal <br>population transfer, land conﬁscation, house demolition and similar policies and practice. Their number has been <br>conservatively  estimated at 75,000 persons.  See Internally  Displaced  Palestinians,  International  Protection,  and 
</p>
<p>Durable Solutions, BADIL Information &amp; Discussion Brief No. 9 (November 2002). </p>
<p>Palestinian IDPs in the OPT since 1967</p>
<p>The estimate (128,708) includes:<br>a) Persons internally displaced  from destroyed Palestinian villages in the  OPT during the 1967 war  (10,000 </p>
<p>persons). This ﬁgure is adjusted on the basis of the average annual growth rate (3.5</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> until 2005, and 3.0</p> <p>percent</p>
<p> for the years 2006-2008);</p>
<p>b) persons (13,000 individuals: 2,000 households with an average of 6.5 persons) whose shelters were totally </p>
<p>destroyed during Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip at the end of 2008 (see OCHA report on Gaza crisis, 30 March <br>2009:</p>
<p>http://www.ochaopt.org/gazacrisis/admin/output/ﬁles/ocha_opt_gaza_humanitarian_situation_</p>

<p>c) the average number of Palestinians displaced by house demolition (1,037) each year between 1967 and 2008 </p>
<p>(see BADIL: Survey of Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons 2006-2007). This number is not <br>adjusted according to the average annual population growth, because it is not known how many IDPs have <br>been able to return to their homes;</p>
<p>d) persons displaced as a result of harassment by Jewish settlers in the OPT: at least 1,014 Palestinian housing units </p>
<p>in the center of Hebron that have been vacated by their occupants in 2007, considering average household of </p>

<p>e) persons displaced as a result of revocation of residency rights in Jerusalem: the total number of ID cards conﬁscated </p>
<p>since 1967 amounts to 8,269 (see PCBS, 2008: Jerusalem Statistical Yearbook, no.10, p. 358). This number does </p>
<p>not include the children (under the age of 16 years) of persons whose resident status was revoked (other sources <br>estimate that 80,000 persons have been affected by the revocation of Jerusalem ID cards since 1967), and it does <br>not account for ID cards that may have been reinstated due to the lack of information. Also not included are <br>4,577 Jerusalem residents who had their ID cards conﬁscated in 2008, preliminary statistics on which were only </p>
<p>published in the last weeks of 2009. Nir Hasson, “Israel Stripped Thousands of Jerusalem Arabs of Residency in <br>2008”, Haaretz, 2 December 2009;

<p>f) 14,364 persons who were displaced by the Wall as of July 2005 (see PCBS, 2008: Jerusalem Statistical Yearbook </p>
<p>no. 10, p. 366), with the population growth (3.0</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p>) added for 2006-2008. </p>
<p>Note: Estimate includes 1948 Palestinian refugees who have subsequently undergone internal displacement in the </p>
<p>OPT. Their number is estimated to be 37,000 persons at the end of 2008 (categories b – f), based on PCBS data <br>which shows that 1948 refugees constitute 40</p>
<p> percent</p>
<p> of the total Palestinian population in the OPT. If displaced </p>
<p>refugees are deducted, the estimate of Palestinian IDPs in the OPT at the end of 2008 amounts to 91,708.</p>
<p>Persons who are neither 1948 nor 1967 Refugees and who are externally displaced</p>
<p>No statistical estimate is possible of the current size of this group, because not enough precise data is available. <br>For illustrative examples and case studies, see Chapter One, Appendix 1.1, Occupation, Apartheid, Colonization

<p>5 Original registration was carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the League of Red Crescent Societies and (in the </p>
<p>Gaza Strip) by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC). During 1950–51, UNRWA carried out a census in all areas of operations, <br>excluding the  Gaza Strip, where it relied on  AFSC records. UNRWA registration includes an individual registration number, a family <br>registration number, and a family code that links the computerized demographic data in the family registration number sheet with the non-<br>computerized data in the family ﬁles. The latter includes birth, marriage, and death certiﬁcates and a limited number of property deeds. <br>For more information, see Reinterpreting the Historical Record: The Uses of Palestinian Refugee Archives for Social Science Research and Policy

<p>is aware of this discrimination and has promised since 2004 to revise this policy, “with a view to enabling descendants of female refugees <br>married to non-refugees to register with UNRWA.” UNRWA stated that the Agency “is of the opinion that the continued application of its <br>registration rules is unfair and unfounded, as the status of refugees should not be based on such considerations, and discrimination between <br>males married to non-refugees vs. females married to non-refugees is unjustiﬁed.... The Agency estimates that this could potentially beneﬁt <br>approximately 340,000 persons, but expects that a signiﬁcantly lower number will actually wish to register. Of those who will register, not all <br>will be interested in availing themselves of the Agency’s services.

<p>of that age. Employed persons include everyone who has worked for at least one hour within a set reference period for pay in cash or in <br>kind, as well as those temporarily absent from a job they perform on a regular basis. The unemployment range is deﬁned as the proportion <br>of unemployed persons among the total labor force.
