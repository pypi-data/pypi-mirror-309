 <h3>Information about this inspection </h3>
<ul>
<li> The inspection team observed 26 lessons or part-lessons in all classes and year groups. Many of these <br>were observed jointly with the headteacher and deputy headteachers. Inspectors also observed sessions 
<br>with small groups of pupils, an assembly and break time. In addition, inspectors scrutinised work in pupils’ 

<br>books in a range of subjects. Inspectors also listened to pupils read. 
</li>
<li> Inspectors held meetings and discussions with pupils, school leaders, teachers, two members of the <br>governing body and two representatives of the local authority.  
</li>
<li> Inspectors took account of the 30 responses from parents to Ofsted’s online questionnaire, Parent View, <br>as well as the outcomes from the most recent parent survey that the school conducted. They also spoke 
<br>to parents informally.  
</li>
<li> Inspectors considered the 47 questionnaire responses received from staff.  
</li>
<li> The inspection team also examined a range of documentation, including those related to safeguarding, the <br>school’s self-evaluation and development plan, the minutes of governing body meetings, information 

<br>about pupils’ progress and attainment, records of behaviour and attendance and records relating to the 
<br>management of staff performance. The school’s website was also scrutinised.

 <h2>Full report </h2>
<h3>Information about this school </h3>
<ul>
<li> Argyle Primary School is much larger than most other primary schools in England. The school is located in <br>a busy area of central London, very close to King’s Cross and St Pancras stations. Children in the early 
<br>years attend school full time. 
</li>
<li> The vast majority of pupils are from minority ethnic groups. This is a much higher proportion than <br>average. The largest group, which accounts for more than half of the school, are pupils from Asian 
<br>Bangladeshi heritage. Most pupils speak English as an additional language. 
</li>
<li> The proportion of disadvantaged pupils supported by the pupil premium is much higher than typically <br>found, and is nearly double the national average. The pupil premium is additional government funding for 
<br>pupils known to be eligible for free school meals and those who are looked after by the local authority.  
</li>
<li> The proportion of disabled pupils or those who have special educational needs is average overall at one in <br>six pupils. The main area of need is speech, language and communication. 
</li>
<li> More pupils than typical leave or join the school other than at the usual times. 
</li>
<li> The school meets the government’s current floor standards, which are the minimum expectations for <br>pupils’ attainment and progress in reading, writing and mathematics by the end of Year 6.  

</li>
<li> Since the previous inspection there have been substantial changes to the staffing of the school, including <br>a new headteacher and Chair of the Governing Body. 
</li>
</ul> <h3>What does the school need to do to improve further? </h3>

<h4> Raise pupils’ achievement and the quality of teaching to outstanding by:  
</h4>
<p>  ensuring that the tasks that teachers set fully challenge pupils, especially the most able <br>  ensuring that all marking is as good as the best seen in English and in Year 6. 
</p>
<ul><li> Improve the attendance of those pupils for whom it is below the national average by engaging more <br>effectively with their families. 
</li></ul>
 
 <h3>Inspection judgements </h3>
<table><tr>
<td>The leadership and management </td>
<td>are good </td>
</tr></table>

<ul>
<li> The headteacher and her senior team have high expectations of all pupils and staff. They have an <br>accurate understanding of the school’s strengths and areas for development, and their plans for 
<br>improvement are good. Parents and staff are very supportive of the school’s leadership. Over 90% of 
<br>parents surveyed said they would recommend the school to others. 
</li>
<li> Leaders at all levels foster good relations, promote equality of opportunity and tackle discrimination <br>effectively, so that all groups of pupils achieve well. Subject leaders carry out their responsibilities 
<br>effectively. For example, they regularly check out how well pupils are learning in different subjects. 
</li>
<li> The school’s curriculum is vibrant, exciting, broad, balanced and meets statutory requirements. This <br>ensures that teachers’ approach to planning and teaching lessons results in good progress. There are 

<br>many opportunities for pupils to develop literacy and numeracy across a range of subjects.  
</li>
<li> The curriculum promotes British values particularly well, not just in lessons, but also through assemblies, <br>opportunities to reflect on local, national and international visits and extra-curricular opportunities outside 
<br>of lesson time. This ensures that pupils learn about democracy and are aware of the importance of 
<br>respecting others, tolerance, tackling discrimination and respecting the rule of law. For example, pupils 
<br>visit the House of Commons to understand how the British political system works. As a result, pupils are 
<br>well prepared for life in modern Britain.  
</li>
<li> The school has made good use of the additional primary sports funding to increase pupils’ interest and <br>participation in sports. For example, boys and girls both participate in fitness and football clubs during 
<br>break times. The school offers a wide range of clubs and activities for pupils to participate in during 
<br>lunchtimes and after school. Some of these are run by experts and specialists which the school has been 
<br>able to pay for with this funding. 
</li>
<li> Leaders, governors and staff consider pupils’ safety as their first concern. Vulnerable pupils are well cared <br>for and record keeping is organised, detailed and kept confidentially. The school’s safeguarding 

<br>procedures meet minimum statutory requirements.  
</li>
<li> The school uses its pupil premium funding effectively. It has invested heavily in additional adults, subject <br>experts and one-to-one and small group tuition to accelerate the progress of disadvantaged pupils and 
<br>enable them to catch up. Inspection evidence shows that the gaps between disadvantaged pupils and 
<br>other pupils in the school are closing quickly as a result. 
</li>
<li> The school manages staff performance well. Teachers and teaching assistants all have challenging targets <br>which are linked to how well pupils make progress. Governors check that only good teaching is rewarded 
<br>with increased pay. Remaining weaknesses are being tackled through training. 
</li>
<li> The school is developing new approaches to assessment to support the new primary curriculum, <br>particularly in writing, which is helping teachers to identify the skills pupils have mastered and what they 
<br>need to do next. The school is working with other schools to make sure that assessments are accurate 
<br>and checked. 
</li>
<li> The school appreciates the effective support it receives from the local authority, which recognises it as a <br>good school. The school has sourced support from the local authority to help school leaders make reliable 
<br>judgements on the quality of teaching, and to help leaders improve attendance.  </li>
<li> The governance of the school: <br>  The governing body is well led by an experienced Chair and is highly ambitious for the school. 

<br>Governors provide good support and challenge to the school’s leaders, and hold them to account for 
<br>how well pupils achieve. They scrutinise information about the quality of teaching and pupils’ progress, 
<br>and ask good questions to make sure that all pupils are achieving as well as they can. Governors 
<br>contribute to the school’s self-evaluation and have an accurate understanding of the school’s strengths 
<br>and areas for development. They have ensured that safeguarding procedures meet minimum statutory 
<br>requirements. 
<br>  Governors have ensured that the pupil premium and primary sports funding is used to good effect.  

</li>
</ul>
<h4> Governors take part in regular training from the local authority, which enables them to understand 
</h4>
<p>performance data and how well the school is doing compared to others. </p>
   
  <table><tr>
<td>The behaviour and safety of pupils </td>
<td>are good </td>
</tr></table>

<p>Behaviour  </p>
<ul>
<li> The behaviour of pupils is good. 
</li>
<li> Pupils are polite, conscientious, well behaved and considerate of one another. Most pupils have good <br>attitudes to learning in lessons, particularly where teaching is good or better. The vast majority of parents, 
<br>pupils and staff agree that behaviour in and around the school is good. 
</li>
<li> Pupils take on a range of leadership responsibilities in the school, including within the school council and <br>through the ‘Argyle Citizens’. Older pupils regularly visit Key Stage 1 classes to help pupils with their 
<br>reading during guided sessions. 
</li>
<li> For the last two years, attendance has been below average and persistent absence has been too high. As <br>a result of the school’s work, sometimes in collaboration with the local authority, attendance is improving 

<br>and is now closer to the national average. Persistent absence is also reducing, but a small number of 
<br>families have not understood the impact of irregular attendance on their children’s progress.   <br>Safety  

</li>
<li> The school’s work to keep pupils safe and secure is good. 
</li>
<li> Pupils demonstrate a good understanding of how to keep safe. Their good behaviour in and around school <br>contributes to a calm and safe school environment. Pupils say that there is always someone that they 
<br>could go to if they had any concerns or were worried about something. They have a good understanding 
<br>of risk. 
</li>
<li> Pupils show a good awareness of bullying and some of the different types, supported through the school’s <br>good personal, social and health education programme. They say that bullying is extremely rare, but that 
<br>if it did happen, they would know what to do. 
</li>
<li> Pupils also understand the importance of e-safety and say that they would know what to do if they <br>experienced cyber-bullying. Pupils are regularly reminded about how to stay safe online. 

</li>
<li> The school site is safe and secure, with appropriate procedures in place to ensure that visitors to the site <br>are checked , vetted and welcomed correctly. 
</li>
<li> Almost all parents, pupils and staff agree that the school keeps children safe. 
</li>
</ul>
 <table><tr>
<td>The quality of teaching </td>
<td>is good </td>
</tr></table>
<ul>
<li> As a result of good teaching over time, pupils in all classes and year groups make good progress in nearly <br>all subjects, including reading, writing and mathematics. Parents and pupils also agree that teaching is 
<br>good. 
</li>
<li> Relationships between pupils and teachers and other adults are strong. This creates a purposeful ethos in <br>classrooms that promotes good progress. 
</li>
<li> Teachers ensure that pupils are very clear about what they need to do in each lesson. As a result, pupils <br>make good progress and use this information to check their learning. 
</li>
<li> Teachers ask good questions which make sure that pupils think about their work. Activities are usually set <br>at the right level, which enables them to make swift progress.  
</li>
<li> Teachers have good subject knowledge, particularly in subjects such as computing, physical education, art <br>and design and technology, where pupils are often taught by subject experts. 
</li>
<li> There is evidence that some of the teaching is leading to outstanding progress. For example, in Year 3 <br>English. Here, work scrutinised and sessions observed showed that the ongoing feedback given by the 
<br>teacher matched individual abilities exceptionally well, and enabled them, for instance, to write the 
<br>beginning of a mystery story extremely effectively.    
</li>
<li> The teaching of phonics (the sounds that letters make) and reading is good overall and pupils learn well. <br>Lessons are well planned, with each group being set work that helps them make progress. As a result, the 
<br>proportion of pupils meeting the expected standard in Year 1 has been above average for the last two 
<br>years.  
</li>
<li> The teaching of disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs is good. These pupils are <br>typically set work which takes into account their needs and abilities and, often with support from teaching 
<br>assistants, this ensures that they learn well. 
</li>
<li> The quality of marking in English is strong. Books are marked regularly, and teachers provide very detailed <br>feedback, particularly in terms of what needs to improve to make their work and learning even better. 
<br>Targets in English and mathematics books are used well to track progress in key skills and knowledge over 
<br>the period of a half term and keep pupils focused on their next steps. However, teachers’ marking and 

<br>feedback in other subjects are not as effective as in English, and sometimes pupils are not clear about 
<br>how their work in these subjects could be improved.  
</li>
</ul>

  <ul><li> Sometimes teaching does not sufficiently extend and challenge the most able, for example where all pupils <br>are set the same work as the others by the teacher, asked the same questions as the others, or where the 
<br>teacher’s explanation at the beginning of the lesson is not clear enough. As a result, in some subjects, 

<br>fewer pupils  attain the highest levels by the end of Key Stage 2. 
</li></ul>
<table><tr>
<td>The achievement of pupils </td>
<td>is good </td>
</tr></table>
<ul>
<li> When children join the school in the Nursery and Reception classes, their skills are below those typically <br>found, particularly in the areas of communication and number. This is because the vast majority of 
<br>children are new to English when they start school. They quickly catch up in the early years, so that by 
<br>the time they leave the Reception Year, they are well prepared for learning in Year 1. 
</li>
<li> At Key Stage 1, pupils’ attainment continues to rise and is now in line with the national average in all <br>subjects, and slightly above in mathematics. This represents good progress.  
</li>
<li> Bangladeshi pupils attain in line with, and sometimes above, the national average.  
</li>
<li> Pupils who join or start school at other than the usual times also achieve well because of close tracking of <br>their progress during their time at school. 
</li>
<li> By the time pupils leave Year 6 at the end of Key Stage 2, their attainment in national tests and <br>assessments is similar to other 11 year olds in the country in reading, writing and mathematics. The 
<br>proportion of pupils that made good progress in all three subjects by the end of Year 6 was higher than 
<br>the national average. 
</li>
<li> Pupils’ attainment is continuing to improve. Many pupils in Year 2 and Year 6 are already working at the <br>levels usually found at the end of the year. More are on track to reach the higher levels than last year. 
</li>
<li> Pupils make good progress in nearly all subjects. Their progress is particularly rapid in physical education <br>and art, because they are taught by subject experts. Work in books and on display in the school, in 
<br>addition to assessment information and test results, shows that pupils’ progress is good throughout the 

<br>school. 
</li>
<li> Pupils enjoy reading and make good progress. Younger pupils choose books that are at the right level, <br>and use their good phonics skills when they are unsure of a word. As a result, more pupils than nationally 
<br>meet the required standard in the phonics check by the end of Year 1 and reading results at Key Stage 1 
<br>are broadly average.  
</li>
<li> The attainment and progress of the most able pupils in the school are improving. In 2014, too few <br>attained the higher levels in reading and mathematics because some were not always stretched and 
<br>challenged in class. This year, as a result of improvements to teaching, more are on track to attain Levels 
<br>5 and 6 in the summer. 
</li>
<li> Disadvantaged pupils make good progress from their different starting points throughout the school. In <br>2014 in reading, disadvantaged pupils were two terms behind other pupils in the school, and a term and a 
<br>half behind other pupils nationally. In writing, they were just over a year behind other pupils in the school, 
<br>and one term behind others nationally. In mathematics, they were just over a year behind others in the 
<br>school, and two terms behind others nationally. Current assessments and work in books show that 
<br>disadvantaged pupils are catching up quickly, and the gap is closing, compared to last year. 
</li>
</ul> <table><tr>
<td>The early years provision </td>
<td>is good </td>
</tr></table>
<ul>
<li> Children settle into the Nursery and Reception classes quickly and well because of the caring work of <br>adults and their good relationships with families. As a result, children make  good progress from their  
<br>starting points in all areas of learning, especially in learning to speak English. The proportion who attain a 
<br>good level of development has increased and is broadly in line with the national average. Children are well 
<br>prepared for entry to Year 1. 
</li>
<li> Teaching in the early years is good. Adults know children very well, and set up activities and tasks inside <br>and outside which interest and stimulate children. They are asked questions that take into account 
<br>children’s interests and previous learning. This enables them to make good progress over time. 

</li>
<li> Children are happy in the Nursery and Reception classes, and their behaviour is good because there are <br>positive relationships between adults, children and their families. The setting is safe and secure. Class 
<br>routines mean that children know what is expected of them, and they follow instructions from adults well. 
<br>Staff make sure that activities in the indoor and outdoor areas are safe. For example, an adult kept a close 
<br>eye on children as they eagerly made rockets using scissors and glue during a Reception class activity. 
<br>Risk assessments are used appropriately, for example when using outdoor apparatus and climbing frames. 
</li>
</ul>

  <ul><li> The leadership and management of the early years are effective. The leader plans activities and <br>experiences with staff together, and tracks children’s progress well over time, so that staff can create 

<br>activities, intervene and ask questions that reflect children’s abilities and interests.
