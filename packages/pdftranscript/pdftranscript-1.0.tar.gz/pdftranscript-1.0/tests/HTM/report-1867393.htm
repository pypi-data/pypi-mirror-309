<p>Page1 </p>  <p>Special measures: monitoring inspection of Victoria Avenue Community Primary <br>School  </p>
<p>Following my visit to your school on 23 and 24 November 2011, I write on behalf of Her <br>Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills to confirm the <br>inspection findings.  <br>The inspection was the third monitoring inspection since the school became subject to <br>special measures following the inspection which took place in December 2010. The full list of <br>the areas for improvement which were identified during that inspection is set out in the <br>annex to this letter. The monitoring inspection report is attached and the main judgements <br>are set out below.  <br>Progress since being subject to special measures – satisfactory  <br>Progress since previous monitoring inspection – satisfactory   <br>Newly Qualified Teachers may not be appointed.   <br>This letter and monitoring inspection report will be posted on the Ofsted website. I am <br>copying this letter and the monitoring inspection report to the Secretary of State, the Chair <br>of the Governing Body and the Strategic Director of Children's Services for Manchester.   <br>Yours sincerely,  <br>Jane Millward <br>Her Majesty's Inspector    </p>

<p>Page2 </p>  <p>Annex <br>The areas for improvement identified during the inspection which took place in 
<br>December 2010  </p> <ul>
<li>  Raise pupils’ attainment, improve achievement and behaviour and eradicate <br>inadequate teaching by: 
<br>-  developing consistent and effective classroom and behaviour management 
<br>procedures 
<br>-  ensuring teachers are secure in the assessment of pupils’ learning 

<br>-  ensuring teachers plan lessons which meet and challenge the individual learning 
<br>needs and interests of all groups and especially boys 
<br>-  ensuring marking consistently helps pupils to improve their work 
<br>-  providing pupils with opportunities to develop respect for others through meeting 
<br>pupils from different religions and cultures to their own, or by studying them 
<br>-  further improve attendance.  </li>
<li>  Improve the quality of the curriculum by: <br>-  ensuring the Early Years Foundation Stage curriculum meets the needs of children 
<br>of this age and, in particular, boys 
<br>-  providing pupils in Years 1 to 6 with the challenging and interesting opportunities 
<br>they need in order to become more motivated by and involved in learning 
<br>-  improving the quality of resources and teaching materials in order to engage pupils 
<br>more effectively.  </li>
<li>  Improve the effectiveness of leadership and management by: <br>-  developing the skills of leaders in evaluating and improving the quality of teaching 
<br>and learning 
<br>-  providing targeted and appropriate training and support for all staff 
<br>-  developing educational partnerships which secure sustainable improvements to 
<br>pupils’ welfare and safety.  </li>
<li>  Improve the effectiveness of the governing body by: <br>-  ensuring governors fulfil their statutory duties, especially in relations to 
<br>safeguarding requirements 
<br>-  ensuring governors receive appropriate training in order to fulfil their roles.     <br>Page3  </li>

 <p>Special measures: monitoring inspection of Victoria Avenue Community Primary <br>School  <br>Report from the third monitoring inspection on 23 and 24 November 2011  <br>Evidence  </p>
<p>Inspectors observed the school's work, scrutinised documents and met with the executive <br>headteacher and acting deputy headteacher, middle leaders, pupils, the Chair of the <br>Governing Body and a representative from the local authority.   </p>
<p>Context </p> <p>Since the last monitoring inspection, one of the executive headteachers has continued to <br>lead the school supported by an acting deputy headteacher and four assistant headteachers. <br>Two teachers have left the school and four teachers have been appointed on temporary <br>fixed-term contracts. Part-time teaching assistants have been replaced by four full-time <br>members of staff. A temporary leader to the Early Years Foundation Stage and a part-time <br>administrator have been appointed. The school continues to move towards academy status 
<br>for January 2012.   </p>
<p>Pupils' achievement and the extent to which they enjoy their learning </p> <p>Results of the national assessments and tests in 2011 indicate that attainment at the end of <br>Year 2 remains low, although some improvements can be seen in reading and mathematics. <br>Attainment at the end of Year 6 has improved in all areas from 2010 with boys performing <br>better than girls. Progress made by pupils overall remains low. However, the progress made <br>by pupils in mathematics has improved considerably with almost all the pupils making the <br>progress expected of them. Current data held by the school show an improving picture. <br>There is evidence to show better progress, with more pupils being on track to reach age-<br>related expectations in reading, writing and mathematics. Since the last monitoring <br>inspection, most progress can be seen in Year 2. In this year group, accelerated progress <br>can be seen for many pupils. Minimal improvements can be seen in the numbers of pupils <br>achieving the higher levels across the school, although better progress by the more able <br>pupils is evident in Year 5.   <br>Groups are now tracked well and vulnerable groups have been identified and their progress <br>is being monitored. This has ensured all teachers and leaders hold a better view of <br>attainment and progress and are able to intervene at an earlier stage where necessary. <br>Pupils known to be eligible for free school meals are making better progress and their <br>attainment is quickly catching up with that of their peers. More targeted interventions have <br>been implemented, which provide pupils requiring support the much-needed help. New <br>resource areas have been set up where pupils learn on a one-to-one basis in a stimulating </p>

<p>and supportive environment. As this work is in its infancy, it is difficult to monitor its <br>effectiveness.  <br>Progress since the last monitoring inspection on the areas for improvement: </p>
<ul>
<li>raise attainment and improve achievement – satisfactory 
</li> </ul>
<p>Other relevant pupil outcomes </p> <p>Generally behaviour has improved and most pupils are polite and courteous. A more <br>consistent approach to the monitoring of poor behaviour has been applied with systematic <br>records maintained by almost all staff. Disruptive behaviour by pupils has decreased. In the 
<br>few lessons observed during the inspection where teachers’ expectations were not high 
<br>enough, behaviour of some pupils slipped. There is evidence to show some improvements in <br>rates of attendance from the previous year. The school tracks attendance and works in close <br>liaison with the local authority. Poor attendance is challenged. The new Friday attendance <br>assemblies reward and encourage pupils to attend school regularly.   <br>Progress since the last monitoring inspection on the areas for improvement: </p>
<ul>
<li>improve behaviour by developing consistent and effective classroom and behaviour <br>management procedures – satisfactory  
</li>
<li>improve attendance – satisfactory 
</li> </ul>
<p>The effectiveness of provision </p> <p>Rigorous monitoring by senior leaders and the local authority shows an improving picture of <br>teaching and learning. Inconsistencies continue to be eradicated through the <br>implementation of coaching techniques. Improved systems to track and monitor the <br>progress made by all pupils and groups are leading to a greater understanding of what <br>pupils need to achieve next. However, there remains variation in the delivery of lessons and <br>activities are not always pitched at an appropriate level. Where this is the case, learning and <br>progress slow. In the more effective lessons, teachers use the learning challenges, </p>
<p>curriculum targets and success criteria to move pupils on in their learning and high </p>
<p>expectations prevail. However, this is not seen across all classes and is not used effectively <br>by all teachers. A marking policy is now in place, although not consistently adhered to by all <br>teachers, with variation across subjects and classes. The planning of lessons is improving, <br>which generally results in better deployment of adults. However, evidence suggests that </p>
<p>teachers’ planning does not always translate into effective classroom activity. Pupils are </p>
<p>more familiar with assessing their own work, which can be seen in pupils’ books and in <br>lessons.   <br>The focus on improving the curriculum through speaking and listening and drama-based <br>activities continues, although leaders are very aware of the necessity to prioritise the </p>
<p>development of pupils’ basic skills. The impact of this approach has been monitored. Plans </p>
<p>are developing to introduce a more skills-based curriculum, although this has not been <br>implemented for all subjects. Staff are undergoing training to support this work and are </p>

<p>beginning to develop curriculum overviews. The school’s leaders acknowledge that breadth </p>
<p>and balance must be ensured and curriculum days have been planned to ensure pupils’ </p>
<p>entitlement is met. The way in which topic work is recorded remains underdeveloped with <br>minimal evidence in some pupils’ books. This has not been monitored by senior leaders.  
 <br>Developing the Early Years Foundation Stage has been a priority for the leaders of the <br>school and improvements can be seen. More purposeful activities have been introduced and <br>a focus on writing and mark making is clearly evident. Links with parents and carers have <br>improved and they are encouraged to bring their child into the classrooms and get actively </p>
<p>involved in ‘writing challenges’ to begin the school day. A new leader is supporting the </p>
<p>development of the Early Years Foundation Stage which is bringing a more unified and <br>consistent approach. Strengths and areas to develop have been identified and progress of <br>all children is now monitored. The indoor environment has been improved and the outdoor <br>learning area continues to be a focus for the school. Learning outside is more purposeful, </p>
<p>but some opportunities are still missed to extend the children’s learning. The recording of <br>children’s achievements is more accurate, but still remains inconsistent across the Early </p>
<p>Years Foundation Stage.  </p>
<p>Progress since the last monitoring inspection on the areas for improvement: </p>
<ul>
<li>improve the quality of teaching and the assessment of pupils’ learning – satisfactory 
</li>
<li>  improve the quality of provision in the Early Years Foundation Stage – satisfactory 
</li>
<li>  improve the quality of the curriculum in Years 1 – 6 – satisfactory 
</li> </ul>
<p>The effectiveness of leadership and management </p> <p>A newly established and extended leadership team is tackling issues and focusing on the <br>priorities which will lead to the necessary changes. Through professional development, some <br>middle leaders are becoming more empowered and hold a better understanding of what <br>needs to be done to improve outcomes for pupils at Victoria Avenue School. Tracking <br>procedures are much improved, leading to greater analysis of attainment and progress for <br>all pupils and groups. This rigorous approach is effective in ensuring all staff are aware of <br>pupil achievement. Furthermore, teachers are now more accountable and make suggestions <br>on how they will improve rates of progress for pupils in their class. Pupil progress meetings <br>are now established where teachers discuss attainment and progress with senior leaders. <br>This information is becoming more closely linked to the implementation of intervention <br>programmes and the deployment of additional adults. While senior leaders are tackling <br>underachievement, more still needs to be done to ensure all pupils achieve their full <br>potential.   <br>Training has been delivered to the governing body. This is better enabling members to hold <br>the school’s leaders to account for their actions. A new system linking key areas for 
<br>improvement to a member of the governing body and a senior leader is a positive <br>development. The findings of which are formally reported to the full governing body. The <br>welfare and safeguarding requirements are a priority for the school. However, the </p>

<p>monitoring of school procedures is not rigorous enough. Training for the safeguarding of <br>pupils has been recently provided for staff and a named governor.   <br>Progress since the last monitoring inspection on the areas for improvement: </p>
<ul>
<li>improve the effectiveness of leadership and management – satisfactory 
</li>
<li>  improve the effectiveness of the governing body – satisfactory 
</li>
<li>  improve the effectiveness of safeguarding procedures – satisfactory 
</li> </ul>
<p>External support </p> <p>The local authority continues to support the school. Regular reviews are held to monitor the </p>
<p>school’s progress against key areas for improvement. Local authority personnel have worked </p>
<p>alongside the governing body, have supported the development of the leadership in the <br>school and attended regular meetings. The local authority has provided satisfactory support.           </p>
