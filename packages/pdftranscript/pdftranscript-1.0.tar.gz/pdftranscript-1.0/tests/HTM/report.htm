<h1>PART A: SUMMARY OF THE REPORT </h1> <h2>INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL </h2> <p>St Mary and St John Catholic Primary School is voluntary aided and has 195 pupils on roll, which is </p>
<p>smaller than most primary schools. The school is situated close to the town centre of Wigan, but serves </p>
<p>a wider area than that. Pupils come from a mixture of owner occupied homes or rented accommodation. </p>
<p>Less than 5 per cent of pupils are currently known to be entitled to free school meals. The majority of the </p>
<p>pupils have white ethnic backgrounds and there are no pupils with English as an additional language. </p>
<p>Just over 20 per cent of pupils are on the school’s special educational needs register, which is broadly </p>
<p>average. There is less than 0.5 per cent of pupils with a statement of special educational need, which is </p>
<p>well below the national average. Attainment on entry to the school is broadly average, but with a wide </p>
<p>spread of recorded ability when pupils are first assessed. The headteacher and chair of governors are </p>
<p>new in post since the previous inspection. </p> <h2>HOW GOOD THE SCHOOL IS </h2> <p>This is a very good and very effective school with many outstanding features. Pupils make excellent </p>
<p>progress overall supported by teaching of a very high standard, a very good curriculum and excellent </p>
<p>leadership and management. With slightly above average costs per pupil, the school provides very good </p>
<p>value for money. </p> <p>What the school does well </p>
<ul>
<li>  Enables its pupils to achieve very high standards in English, mathematics, science and music at the <br>age of eleven. 
</li>
<li>  Provides excellent teaching overall, leading to outstanding levels of learning. 
</li>
<li>  Enables all its pupils to make excellent progress over their time in school. 
</li>
<li>  Provides outstanding levels of leadership and management. 
</li>
<li>  With the help of the parish and community, successfully develops the whole child spiritually, <br>morally and socially in a caring atmosphere against a background of very good behaviour and 
<br>excellent relationships. 
</li>
<li>  Ensures through careful planning that all children in the school are fully included in all activities and <br>events and that there is equal access to learning opportunities.   <br>What could be improved 
</li>
<li>  The inspection team found no areas of any significance for the school to develop as an action plan. <br>The areas for improvement will form the basis of the governors’ action plan. 
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>HOW THE SCHOOL HAS IMPROVED SINCE ITS LAST INSPECTION </h2> <p>There has been very good improvement since the school was previously inspected in April 1997. A new </p>
<p>headteacher and new chair of governors have been appointed since then  and all the issues for </p>
<p>improvement have been targeted and successfully accomplished. This has resulted in a steady and </p>
<p>sustained improvement in standards in every area of the school, but especially for older pupils aged </p>
<p>eleven in English, mathematics and science. Information and communication technology (ICT) has </p>
<p>improved greatly and it is now a key feature of all lessons, affecting learning positively across the </p>
<p>curriculum. The most significant improvements have taken place in teaching and in leadership and </p>
<p>management. The way in which the work of the school is guided and directed is currently outstanding </p>
<p>and, as a result, the school is in a very strong position to continue sustaining its high standards and to </p>
<p>keep pace with any changes in the future. </p> 

<h2>STANDARDS 
</h2> <p>The table shows the standards achieved by pupils at the end of Year 6 based on average point scores in </p>
<p>National Curriculum tests. </p> <p>  compared with </p>

<p>well below average  E </p> <p>The 2000 national test results show pupils reaching well above average standards in English and </p>
<p>mathematics, and very high standards, in the top five per cent nationally, in science. The more recently </p>
<p>published 2001 results show a similar pattern, but with a slight decline in the proportion of pupils </p>
<p>reaching the higher level in science. The current Year 6 pupils, however, are working at very high levels </p>
<p>in all three subjects and making excellent progress in most lessons. The school has worked hard to </p>
<p>overcome identified weaknesses in mathematics and standards have risen during the past 18 months. </p>
<p>Compared to the performance of pupils in similar settings, the school is well above average. The </p>
<p>proportion of pupils reaching the higher level 5 at age eleven is well above the national average overall. </p>
<p>Over time, standards have been consistently well above the national average.  </p> <p>Children enter the school with levels of attainment that are broadly average, although there is a wide </p>
<p>range of ability when they are first assessed. Progress in the early years is rapid and this is sustained up </p>
<p>until the age of seven, where the year 2000 national tests showed pupils to be in the top five per cent of </p>
<p>schools nationally in reading and writing, and well above average in mathematics and science. Pupils’ </p>
<p>work shows that these impressive standards are sustained and built on in the junior section of the school, </p>
<p>where a key feature of learning is the broadening of pupils’ education through very good links between </p>
<p>subjects. Gifted and talented pupils make excellent progress and achieve very high standards as a result </p>
<p>of being encouraged to develop their creativity and by being provided with appropriately challenging </p>
<p>work. Pupils identified as having special educational needs make excellent progress over time and reach </p>
<p>levels that are outstanding for them personally. </p> <p>The school’s targets for improvement have been met as a result of identifying and improving relatively </p>
<p>weaker areas of learning, such as in science or mathematics. </p> <h2>PUPILS’ ATTITUDES AND VALUES 
</h2> <p>Aspect  Comment </p>
<p>Attitudes to the school  Excellent  – pupils love the school and are really keen to do well; they </p>
<p>enjoy learning. </p>
<p>Behaviour, in and out of </p>
<p>classrooms </p>
<p>Very good in and out of the classroom, with very good levels of self-</p>
<p>control. There have been no exclusions during the last decade. </p>
<p>Personal development </p>
<p>and relationships </p>
<p>Excellent throughout the  school and making a strong contribution to </p>
<p>effective learning. </p>
<p>Attendance  Well above the national average and a significant contribution to the </p>
<p>outstanding progress made. </p>  

<h2>TEACHING AND LEARNING </h2> <p>Teaching of pupils in:  Reception  Years 1 – 2  Years 3 – 6 </p>
<p>Quality of teaching  Excellent   Excellent   Excellent  </p>
<p>Inspectors make judgements about teaching in the range: excellent; very good; good; satisfactory; unsatisfactory; </p>
<p>poor; very poor. ‘Satisfactory’ means that the teaching is adequate and strengths outweigh weaknesses. </p> <p>Teaching is excellent overall. Inspectors recorded nothing less than good teaching during the inspection, </p>
<p>with a very high proportion of excellent and very good teaching throughout the school, including in the </p>
<p>Foundation Stage. All teachers have very good levels of knowledge and understanding of the subjects of </p>
<p>the National Curriculum and they manage their classes in an excellent fashion. Support staff have </p>
<p>meaningful and purposeful tasks to do and they give pupils’ learning a great boost whenever they are </p>
<p>present. Teachers use resources very well and the challenge offered to pupils is outstandingly good. The </p>
<p>basic skills of literacy and numeracy are taught in an excellent way, enabling pupils to learn at a very </p>
<p>rapid rate and make outstanding progress over time. Teachers make lessons very interesting by cross-</p>
<p>referencing learning in one lesson to learning in another, on a frequent basis. This successfully broadens </p>
<p>pupils’ experiences and they learn the principles of transferring skills and understanding from one </p>
<p>subject to another. Early identification of all pupils with special educational needs, including the gifted </p>
<p>and talented, enables teachers to plan effectively, and for these pupils to receive challenging learning </p>
<p>throughout the school. The way in which work is matched to the needs of each group of pupils in lessons </p>
<p>is an outstanding feature of the success in planning and organisation.  </p> <h2>OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SCHOOL </h2> <p>Aspect  Comment </p>
<p>The quality and range of </p>
<p>the curriculum </p>
<p>Very good and fully in compliance with statutory requirements. The </p>
<p>curriculum is made very attractive through strong links between subjects </p>
<p>and by covering a wide range of interesting and stimulating topics. Extra-</p>
<p>curricular activities are satisfactory and enhance the curriculum </p>
<p>appropriately. </p>
<p>Provision for pupils with </p>
<p>special educational needs</p> <p>Very good, and leading to successful achievement for all these pupils by </p>
<p>the age of eleven. </p>
<p>Provision for pupils’ </p>
<p>personal, including </p>
<p>spiritual, moral, social </p>
<p>and cultural development </p>
<p>Very good in lessons and assemblies. The school’s provision in this area </p>
<p>is embedded very well into its philosophy of broadening pupils’ education </p>
<p>and developing the whole child fully. </p>
<p>How well the school </p>
<p>cares for its pupils </p>
<p>Good overall, but with  outstanding features such as the use of </p>
<p>assessment to help pupils make progress and the staff knowledge and </p>
<p>understanding of the personal and academic needs of each individual </p>
<p>pupil. </p>


<h2>HOW  WELL THE SCHOOL IS LED AND MANAGED </h2> <p>Aspect  Comment </p>
<p>Leadership and </p>
<p>management by the </p>
<p>headteacher and other </p>
<p>key staff </p>
<p>Outstanding teamwork, commitment to high standards, clarity of vision </p>
<p>and very high standards of monitoring and evaluating progress and </p>
<p>success contribute to this excellent feature of the school. </p>
<p>How well  the governors </p>
<p>fulfil their responsibilities </p>
<p>Governors have a very good understanding of the work of the school, </p>
<p>including its strengths and areas for development. The strategic use of </p>
<p>finances when planning, obtaining good value for money and support in </p>
<p>the classroom are strong features of the work of governors. </p>
<p>The school’s evaluation </p>
<p>of its performance </p>
<p>Excellent. The school has realistic targets with open and shared </p>
<p>management strategies, enabling all to participate fully and have some </p>
<p>stake in the ownership of the education process. </p>
<p>The strategic use of  </p>
<p>resources </p>
<p>Very good. The school is very well resourced and any minor issues, such </p>
<p>as extending sections of the teaching areas, are planned well and </p>
<p>effectively carried out. </p>  <h2>PARENTS’ AND CARERS’ VIEWS OF THE SCHOOL 
</h2> <p>What pleases parents most  What parents would like to see improved </p>
<ul>
<li>  Standards and the progress pupils make. 
</li>
<li>  The good attitudes promoted by the school <br>in accordance with the stated Catholic aims. 
</li>
<li>  Very good standards of behaviour. 
</li>
<li>  Teaching is very good. 
</li>
<li>  Leadership and management are very good.
</li> <li>  A small minority of parents are unhappy with <br>the range of extra-curricular activities. 
  <br>Inspectors fully endorse the positive views of parents. The range and extent of extra-curricular activities 

<br>was judged satisfactory by inspectors, bearing in mind that the school offers its pupils a very broad and 

<br>wide ranging curriculum during lesson times.
</li>
</ul>


<h1>PART B: COMMENTARY </h1> <h2>WHAT THE SCHOOL DOES WELL </h2> <h2>Enables its pupils to achieve very high standards in English, mathematics, science and 
</h2>
<h2>music at the age of eleven. </h2> <p>1.  Standards of work seen during the inspection were very high for the oldest pupils in the school. In </p>
<p>English, mathematics and science, the current Year 6 pupils were working at levels that place them </p>
<p>in the top five per cent of pupils nationally. In all three subjects, pupils have very secure knowledge </p>
<p>and understanding. This is a significant improvement since the previous inspection. Over time, the </p>
<p>school’s results have been well above the national average and have been rising at a greater rate </p>
<p>than the national trend. </p> <p>2.  Writing is of a very high standard. Letters are clearly formed and work is very well presented. </p>
<p>Pupils use a wide range of vocabulary in their writing and their spelling is of an equally high </p>
<p>standard. Pupils’ speech is articulate and clear, when answering questions, and when doing </p>
<p>presentations in assemblies. Pupils are able to explain clearly why they are doing a specific task, or </p>
<p>they can explain the strategies they are using when solving a problem or working on a task in </p>
<p>groups. Pupils read avidly, freely and with enjoyment.  </p> <p>3.  In mathematics, standards are also very high. Pupils’ understanding of fractions, decimals and </p>
<p>percentages and how to convert from one to the others is excellent. Pupils work very rapidly when </p>
<p>calculating in their heads and they have very good knowledge and understanding of how to use </p>
<p>calculators in other circumstances. All pupils have a firm grasp of ratio and proportion, they handle </p>
<p>data with confidence and they have developed very good problem-solving strategies.  </p>  <p>4.  In science, work is presented to a very high standard in terms of content, understanding, layout and </p>
<p>illustrations. Work is linked very well to visits, such as a recent one to a local wildlife trust. Work on </p>
<p>food chains and food webs and on photosynthesis is factually accurate and pupils’ understanding is </p>
<p>very well developed.  </p> <p>5.  In music lessons and in hymn practice, pupils’ understanding of technical terms is excellent. They </p>
<p>all know terms such as dynamic, rhythm, tempo and beat; they sing to a very high standard, </p>
<p>applying the technical language in a real practical sense as they vary the volume and keep to </p>
<p>rhythmic patterns very well. Diction when singing is very clear. Pupils are imaginative and creative </p>
<p>in composition. They re-create evocative descriptive compositions to parody specific animals, </p>
<p>having listened effectively to various portrayals from the Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saens in </p>
<p>Year 3. </p> <p>6.  Pupils gain great benefit by having literacy and numeracy skills reinforced in many other areas of </p>
<p>the curriculum. In history, for example, pupils in Year 4 are given plenty of opportunities to explore </p>
<p>their imagination and develop their skills by writing as if they were characters in the Victorian era, </p>
<p>such as a servant or governess at Haigh Hall. Year 6 work in literacy is linked very effectively to </p>
<p>geography through an appreciation of languages in India. Science affords many opportunities for </p>
<p>pupils to measure, calculate and interpret data, or to write up effective descriptions and evaluations </p>
<p>of their experiments. This constant reinforcement of skills across the curriculum makes a very </p>
<p>strong contribution to learning for all pupils throughout the school and leads to the high standards </p>
<p>recorded in the national tests and seen in the work during the inspection. </p> <p>Provides excellent teaching overall, leading to outstanding levels of learning. </p> <p>7.  Teaching throughout the school, including the Foundation Stage, is excellent with many very good </p>
<p>features. This is a very significant improvement since the previous inspection. Lessons are </p>
<p>thoroughly planned and aimed at ensuring that all pupils make equally good progress. This is </p>
<p>achieved by matching the work precisely to the needs of each group of pupils. Using the wealth of </p>
<p>helpers and assistants to the full, whole classes are often split into four or five separate groups, </p>
<p>each with an adult helper, whether classroom assistant or voluntary helper. In Year 2 mathematics, </p>


<p>for example, this enabled the teacher to create four groups, each working at a slightly different </p>
<p>level, but with each having its own set of challenges as pupils consolidated their learning and </p>
<p>understanding of number patterns. </p> <p>8.  Teachers have excellent understanding of how pupils learn and this is especially true of the </p>
<p>reception age children. By careful planning and making excellent links across learning areas, the </p>
<p>teacher ensures that basic literacy and numeracy skills become embedded into children’s thinking </p>
<p>from a very early age. Learning mathematics is made fun for children who have just come into </p>
<p>school, by using number rhymes; in sessions with an English language focus, the teacher uses </p>
<p>humour and body movements very imaginatively in order to help children learn the names and </p>
<p>sounds of letters of the alphabet.  </p> <p>9.  Teachers ensure that all pupils learn basic skills very well. There is very good attention paid to all </p>
<p>the skills of literacy  – speaking, listening, reading and writing  – not just in English, but across other </p>
<p>subject areas as well. For instance, in a Year 3 music lesson, pupils were expected to sit and listen </p>
<p>as they heard a piece by one of the great composers and they were expected to be able to interpret </p>
<p>its meaning. In science, there is a very high expectation that all work will be neatly presented and </p>
<p>clearly laid out, which is successfully achieved by the majority of pupils. Pupils are given </p>
<p>opportunities to act out roles in assemblies, to project their voices and to speak in a clear manner. </p>
<p>There are specific sessions of extended writing given to pupils linked to other subjects such as </p>
<p>history or geography. Numeracy skills are used extensively in weighing and measuring when </p>
<p>making soup in food technology in the Infants section. Pupils learn to count rhythm and beat in </p>
<p>music, so, when singing in parts, they enter at an appropriate time. In ICT, pupils were encouraged </p>
<p>to access specific information from a range of programs to enhance their work in history on the </p>
<p>Victorian era. Pupils learn very effectively how to convert data into graphs in science lessons using </p>
<p>ICT. </p> <p>10.  Teachers manage their classes very well. There are very high expectations of good behaviour and </p>
<p>quality of work. Pupils knuckle down to their studies with a minimum of fuss. They enjoy the high </p>
<p>challenges and large numbers of hands fly up frequently when the teacher is questioning them in </p>
<p>lessons, all eager to succeed and have a go. Even in assemblies, in front of much larger </p>
<p>audiences, pupils are not afraid of having a shot at answering questions. Pupils are highly </p>
<p>motivated by the interesting and dynamic way in which lessons are taught and they are very </p>
<p>productive as they seek solutions to problems or in completing group tasks.  </p> <p>11.  Learning is greatly enhanced by the very effective use of resources. Rapid learning took place </p>
<p>around the interactive white-board computer screen, as pupils learnt the skills of using </p>
<p>spreadsheets in Year 5, and in Year 6 of how to import and paste a picture from a file in one </p>
<p>program to a file in another. Using counting blocks, number squares and number lines, pupils </p>
<p>rapidly consolidate their understanding of numbers up to twenty in Year 1, making excellent </p>
<p>progress in acquiring the basic skills of counting on and backwards. In Year 3, pupils learn the art of </p>
<p>composition by using a wide range of tuned and untuned percussion instruments, learning to be </p>
<p>creative with sound and to work co-operatively in groups. In Year 5, pupils learn the art of making </p>
<p>special effects when writing a play, with the teacher having prepared a very good introduction to </p>
<p>outline the differences between a radio play and TV play. </p> <p>Enables all its pupils to make excellent progress over their time in school. </p> <p>12.  On entry to the school, children’s attainment varies greatly, but it is broadly average. By the end of </p>
<p>their time in school, standards are very high. This is excellent progress over time and a significant </p>
<p>improvement since the previous inspection.  </p> <p>13.  Progress is very high in all the key areas of learning. Skills in literacy begin in the Foundation </p>
<p>Stage from the very beginning. The teacher focuses very well on ensuring that pupils learn the </p>
<p>correct sounds when saying names out loud and vocabulary is learnt as pupils begin to write in </p>
<p>booklets on a theme of ‘myself’. In the rest of the school, pupils are encouraged to count whenever </p>
<p>possible, often during registration periods when the teacher announces the number on roll, those </p>
<p>absent and asks for the number present. Musical instruments such as the xylophone are used </p>
<p>effectively to reinforce counting in Year 1. Pupils learn their tables rapidly and many have become </p>
<p>very proficient at controlling the mouse when designing patterns on the computer. By Year 2, </p>


<p>standards have risen at a very rapid rate and, in 2000, standards of reading and writing were in the </p>
<p>top five per cent of schools nationally and well above average in mathematics and science. This is </p>
<p>extraordinary progress over a relatively short time. </p>
<p>14.  As pupils move on to the junior section of the school, these standards are sustained effectively. </p>
<p>Standards are equally high by the age of eleven in English, mathematics and science, with a </p>
<p>significant proportion of pupils each year achieving the higher levels in the national tests. Pupils </p>
<p>learn to read quickly and effectively, digesting information rapidly and being able to recall aspects </p>
<p>of the story, or the names of characters readily. Progress in number work is also excellent. Pupils </p>
<p>consolidate their prior learning well and very good planning across the whole curriculum ensures </p>
<p>that pupils apply this learning well. For example, pupils learn and apply the skills of data conversion </p>
<p>to graphs in geography and history; they interpret census figures in history and use their very good </p>
<p>knowledge of measure to follow the beat in music and use their understanding of space when </p>
<p>designing purses in design and technology.  </p> <p>15.  Progress in learning a new hymn for all the juniors was judged to be outstanding during a hymn </p>
<p>practice. Within ten minutes, all the pupils had learnt the melody of a new hymn and could sing it </p>
<p>very well in four parts. Such rapid progress was dependent upon clear instructions to follow the </p>
<p>words as the piano was played, outstandingly good leadership by the two teachers when bringing </p>
<p>the pupils in to sing their various parts and a determination by pupils to get it right from the start. </p>
<p>Co-operation and concentration in this session, and in many other lessons seen during the </p>
<p>inspection, are major factors in ensuring rapid learning and high standards. </p> <p>Provides outstanding levels of leadership and management. </p> <p>16.  A very significant improvement since the previous inspection has been in the quality of leadership </p>
<p>and management. Most of the issues raised in the last report were responsibilities strongly linked to </p>
<p>management. These have been completely addressed through careful action planning. The school </p>
<p>is excellently led by the headteacher. She is equally proficient in her role as teacher, leader and </p>
<p>manager. She knows all her staff and pupils exceptionally well. She is often in the classrooms as a </p>
<p>support to staff whenever management duties  allow. Her style of management is one of corporate </p>
<p>decision making. This has been extremely successful in establishing a family atmosphere within the </p>
<p>school where all persons are treated with respect and their contributions valued. Staff share a </p>
<p>corporate vision and are committed to sustaining the high standards and to ensuring that each pupil </p>
<p>gets the best possible education. The senior management team is active in establishing clear </p>
<p>targets for future development; there is a high level of lesson observation and evaluation in order to </p>
<p>improve techniques and teaching performance. Teachers share their areas for improvement and </p>
<p>celebrate their successes in an atmosphere of mutual and professional understanding. Subject </p>
<p>leaders monitor planning and have regular release time for work in their own areas of responsibility. </p>
<p>This has resulted in the provision of a very good curriculum with strong links between subjects and </p>
<p>a broad learning diet for pupils as they mature. </p> <p>17.  Governors are now far more active in the school. All the outstanding financial and other issues </p>
<p>raised by the previous audit report have been addressed successfully. Governors are aware of the </p>
<p>strengths and relative weaknesses of the school and are as equally anxious as the senior </p>
<p>management team to ensure that all strengths are built upon and all weaknesses are removed. </p>
<p>These areas for improvement, which reflect the relatively lower standards in some areas of </p>
<p>mathematics including investigation and problem solving, have become a sharp focus in the school </p>
<p>development plan. Governors and management ensure that the aims of the school are reflected </p>
<p>fully in the work of the school and, in this, they are extremely successful. </p> <p>18.  There is a strong spirit of co-operation among staff and long term planning is of a very high quality. </p>
<p>The new planning is following national guidelines, suitably amended to meet the needs of the pupils </p>
<p>at the school. Strong links with the parish and community ensure additional help is on hand in </p>
<p>classrooms, when pupils visit sites in the area, or to provide support for extra-curricular sporting </p>
<p>activities. Inspectors noted that this aspect of the school was a substantial feature in promoting </p>
<p>very good and often excellent learning in classrooms. </p> <p>With the help of the parish and community, successfully develops the whole child spiritually, </p>
<p>morally and socially in a caring atmosphere against a background of very good behaviour and </p>
<p>excellent relationships. </p>

 <p>19.  There is a very strong community feel to the school. There are very good links to the parishes </p>
<p>where many of the pupils and parents live. Relationships are very positive throughout the school. </p>
<p>Pupils work very well together, especially when composing music together, solving mathematical </p>
<p>problems, or refining designs in design and technology. Pupils have great respect for their teachers </p>
<p>and work very well for them on the tasks set. This is a most harmonious community dedicated to </p>
<p>improving learning and achieving high standards. All visitors are made welcome and parents are </p>
<p>regularly encouraged to become part of their children’s learning. Many are active in school on a </p>
<p>regular basis. </p> <p>20.  Parents approve strongly of the moral values and attitudes promoted by the school. There is a </p>
<p>strong commitment to learning the faith and its moral values. Assemblies build very well on the </p>
<p>themes being discussed in personal and social education lessons, religious education or in literacy, </p>
<p>such as friendship and Baptism. Pupils make regular collections for local and international </p>
<p>charities, where the focus is on thinking of someone less fortunate than themselves. Pupils take </p>
<p>part frequently in local musical and arts festivals and events, and the awards gained are on </p>
<p>prominent display in an entrance foyer that declares that the school is about success and </p>
<p>achievement. Older pupils in Years 5 and 6 benefit greatly from residential experiences in this </p>
<p>country and abroad, helping to broaden their social skills and cultural awareness effectively. In </p>
<p>discussion, pupils said the school trips were one of their favourite activities, especially joint trips </p>
<p>with other schools where they had opportunities to meet different pupils. </p> <p>21.  The school provides frequent and regular opportunities for pupils to reflect, assess and evaluate </p>
<p>what they are doing. In assemblies, pupils think about the theme of the session before saying a </p>
<p>prayer; in lessons, they are encouraged to assess what they have written or said, but in a self-</p>
<p>critical manner, with the emphasis on how might it be improved. Work on display in art and design </p>
<p>and design and technology contains pupils’ own evaluations of their finished products. Pupils said </p>
<p>they loved to see their work on display and that it made them feel proud to be part of the school. </p> <p>22.  Behaviour is very good throughout the school and this makes a significant contribution to learning. </p>
<p>Pupils come into registration in the morning prepared to learn. They are calm and orderly as they </p>
<p>start the day. A very good tone for subsequent learning is set. Pupils move around the school to the </p>
<p>hall for music or physical education or assemblies in a sensible and self-disciplined manner. They </p>
<p>behave very well in the playground where older Year 6 pupils support younger ones extremely </p>
<p>effectively. They mix and socialise very well. Pupils show great respect for the adults who work with </p>
<p>them. The good behaviour and absence of any oppressive behaviour gives pupils great confidence </p>
<p>in their school and an added determination to give of their best and succeed. </p> <p>Ensures, through careful planning, that all children in the school are fully included in all </p>
<p>activities and events and that there is equal access to learning opportunities. </p> <p>23.  All pupils are valued equally in the school. Great care is taken to ensure that, through careful </p>
<p>planning, each child has equality of opportunity and access to all areas of school life. Whenever </p>
<p>teachers question pupils in lessons, they ensure that the appropriate level of question is directed to </p>
<p>each pupil in order to challenge them effectively. Pupils are regularly assessed and teachers keep </p>
<p>a careful record in order to ensure that any work set is suitable to the known level of each </p>
<p>individual, or group of individuals. Early assessment of children in the reception class ensures that </p>
<p>any specific needs are identified and planned for from an early age. Other information gathered </p>
<p>through tests or observations by staff is used to the benefit of pupils. Those who are showing any </p>
<p>signs of struggling to keep up with their work are given additional help through the register of </p>
<p>special educational need if the problem persists. Pupils who are showing specific talents in any </p>
<p>areas are quickly identified and given additional challenging material to work with so that they </p>
<p>move forward at an appropriate pace. Staff know their pupils extremely well and are aware of a </p>
<p>wide range of personal and academic problems and issues. Teachers ensure that all pupils learn </p>
<p>well in lessons by moving around the room during groupwork and questioning pupils and their </p>
<p>understanding of the tasks they are engaged upon.  </p> <p>24.  The school ensures that all pupils have equal access to residential trips, whether abroad to northern </p>
<p>France, or more locally to the Lake District. If financial problems occur, funds have been provided </p>
<p>from a range of sources so that no pupil is excluded. An LEA bursary is made available in similar </p>


<p>cases over specialist music tuition. Even though the school is built on a relatively steep slope, </p>
<p>access to all areas is assured through exterior ramps and wide doors. Through close liaison with </p>
<p>parents, with specialist external help and from within the shared expertise in school, there is </p>
<p>appropriate help and support given to pupils at all times. </p>
