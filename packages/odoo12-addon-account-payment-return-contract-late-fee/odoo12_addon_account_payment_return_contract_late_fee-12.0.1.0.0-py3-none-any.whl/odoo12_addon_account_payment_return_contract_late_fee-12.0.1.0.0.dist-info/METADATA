This module applies late fee charges on contract returns.

The module activates when a payment return is confirmed and applies additional charges to associated contracts if found or otherwise creates an invoice for the selected partner.

 Configuration

To configure this module you will need to go to general settings and inside invoicing tab find the section `Manage fees for returned Payments on partners`.

 Usage
*******

To use this module, you will need to make sure that you have set the right configuration to your needs and then you are ready to go!
Every time a payment return associated with a partner is confirmed, this module will add a line to the oldest active contract.
If no contracts are found, it will create an open invoice for them only with that same fee.
