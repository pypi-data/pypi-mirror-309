cuQuantum SDK: A High-Performance Library for Accelerating Quantum Information Science
**************************************************************************************

`NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_ is a high-performance library for quantum information science and beyond.
Currently its primary target is *quantum circuit simulations* and it consists of two major components:

* cuStateVec: a high-performance library for state vector computations
* cuTensorNet: a high-performance library for tensor network computations

In addition to C APIs, cuQuantum also provides Python APIs via `cuQuantum Python`_.

.. _cuQuantum Python: https://pypi.org/project/cuquantum-python/

Documentation
=============

Please refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/index.html for the cuQuantum documentation.

Installation
============

The cuQuantum wheel can be installed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cuquantum-cuXX

where XX is the CUDA major version (currently CUDA 11 and 12 are supported).
We encourage users to install package *with* the ``-cuXX`` suffix;
the package ``cuquantum`` (without the ``-cuXX`` suffix) currently points to ``cuquantum-cu11``
and is subject to change in the future.

.. note::

   This package is a "meta"-package -- installing it will install both ``custatevec-cuXX`` and ``cutensornet-cuXX``
   that are released in the installed cuQuantum SDK version.

.. note::

   To use cuQuantum's Python APIs, please directly install `cuQuantum Python`_.
