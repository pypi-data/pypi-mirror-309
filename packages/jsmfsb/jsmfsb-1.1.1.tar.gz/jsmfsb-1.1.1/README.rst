JAX-SMfSB (jsmfsb)
==================

SMfSB code in Python+JAX
------------------------

Python code relating to the book `Stochastic Modelling for Systems
Biology, third edition <https://github.com/darrenjw/smfsb/>`__.

There is a regular Python+Numpy package on PyPI,
`smfsb <https://pypi.org/project/smfsb/>`__, which has complete coverage
of the book. If you are new to the book and/or this codebase, that might
be a simpler place to start.

*This* package covers all of the *core simulation and inference
algorithms* from the book, including the parsing of SBML and
SBML-shorthand models. These core algorithms will run very fast, using
`JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/>`__. Computationally intensive
algorithms will typically run between 50 and 150 times faster than they
would using the regular ``smfsb`` package, even without a GPU (but
YMMV). You must install JAX (which is system dependent), before
attempting to install this package. See the `JAX
documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__
for details, but for a CPU-only installation, it should be as simple as
``pip install jax``.

Once you have JAX installed and working correctly, you can install this
package with:

.. code:: bash

   pip install jsmfsb

To upgrade already installed package:

.. code:: bash

   pip install --upgrade jsmfsb

**Note** that a number of breaking syntax changes (more pythonic names)
were introduced in version 1.1.0. If you upgrade to a version >= 1.1.0
from a version prior to 1.1.0 you will have to update syntax to the new
style.

You can test that your installation is working by entering the following
at a python prompt:

.. code:: python

   import jax
   import jsmfsb

If these both return silently, you are probably good to go.

Basic usage
-----------

Note that **the book**, and its associated `github
repo <https://github.com/darrenjw/smfsb>`__ is the main source of
documentation for this library. The code in the book is in R, but the
code in this library is supposed to mirror the R code, but in Python.

Using a model built-in to the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, see how to simulate a built-in (Lotka-Volterra predator-prey)
model:

.. code:: python

   import jax
   import jsmfsb

   lvmod = jsmfsb.models.lv()
   step = lvmod.step_gillespie()
   k0 = jax.random.key(42)
   out = jsmfsb.sim_time_series(k0, lvmod.m, 0, 30, 0.1, step)
   assert(out.shape == (300, 2))

If you have ``matplotlib`` installed (``pip install matplotlib``), then
you can also plot the results with:

.. code:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   fig, axis = plt.subplots()
   for i in range(2):
       axis.plot(range(out.shape[0]), out[:,i])

   axis.legend(lvmod.n)
   fig.savefig("lv.pdf")

Standard python docstring documentation is available. Usage information
can be obtained from the python REPL with commands like
``help(jsmfsb.Spn)``, ``help(jsmfsb.Spn.step_gillespie)`` or
``help(jsmfsb.sim_time_series)``. This documentation is also available
on `ReadTheDocs <https://jax-smfsb.readthedocs.io/>`__. The API
documentation contains very minimal usage examples. For more interesting
examples, see the `demos
directory <https://github.com/darrenjw/jax-smfsb/tree/main/demos>`__.

Creating and simulating a model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, letâ€™s create and simulate our own (SIR epidemic) model by
specifying a stochastic Petri net explicitly.

.. code:: python

   import jax.numpy as jnp
   sir = jsmfsb.Spn(["S", "I", "R"], ["S->I", "I->R"],
       [[1,1,0],[0,1,0]], [[0,2,0],[0,0,1]],
       lambda x, t: jnp.array([0.3*x[0]*x[1]/200, 0.1*x[1]]),
       [197.0, 3, 0])
   step_sir = sir.step_poisson()
   sample = jsmfsb.sim_sample(k0, 500, sir.m, 0, 20, step_sir)
   fig, axis = plt.subplots()
   axis.hist(sample[:,1], 30)
   axis.set_title("Infected at time 20")
   plt.savefig("sIr.pdf")

Reading and parsing models in SBML and SBML-shorthand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that you can read in SBML or SBML-shorthand models that have been
designed for discrete stochastic simulation into a stochastic Petri net
directly. To read and parse an SBML model, use

.. code:: python

   m = jsmfsb.file_to_spn("myModel.xml")

Note that if you are working with SBML models in Python using
`libsbml <https://pypi.org/project/python-libsbml/>`__, then there is
also a function ``model_to_spn`` which takes a libsbml model object.

To read and parse an SBML-shorthand model, use

.. code:: python

   m = jsmfsb.mod_to_spn("myModel.mod")

There is also a function ``shorthand_to_spn`` which expects a python
string containing a shorthand model. This is convenient for embedding
shorthand models inside python scripts, and is particularly convenient
when working with things like Jupyter notebooks. Below follows a
complete session to illustrate the idea by creating and simulating a
realisation from a discrete stochastic SEIR model.

.. code:: python

   import jax
   import jsmfsb
   import jax.numpy as jnp

   seir_sh = """
   @model:3.1.1=SEIR "SEIR Epidemic model"
    s=item, t=second, v=litre, e=item
   @compartments
    Pop
   @species
    Pop:S=100 s
    Pop:E=0 s    
    Pop:I=5 s
    Pop:R=0 s
   @reactions
   @r=Infection
    S + I -> E + I
    beta*S*I : beta=0.1
   @r=Transition
    E -> I
    sigma*E : sigma=0.2
   @r=Removal
    I -> R
    gamma*I : gamma=0.5
   """

   seir = jsmfsb.shorthand_to_spn(seir_sh)
   step_seir = seir.step_gillespie()
   k0 = jax.random.key(42)
   out = jsmfsb.sim_time_series(k0, seir.m, 0, 40, 0.05, step_seir)

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   fig, axis = plt.subplots()
   for i in range(len(seir.m)):
       axis.plot(jnp.arange(0, 40, 0.05), out[:,i])

   axis.legend(seir.n)
   fig.savefig("seir.pdf")

A `collection of appropriate
models <https://github.com/darrenjw/smfsb/tree/master/models>`__ is
associated with the book.

Converting from the ``smfsb`` python package
--------------------------------------------

The API for this package is very similar to that of the ``smfsb``
package. The main difference is that non-deterministic (random)
functions have an extra argument (typically the first argument) that
corresponds to a JAX random number key. See the `relevant
section <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/random-numbers.html>`__ of
the JAX documentation for further information regarding random numbers
in JAX code.
