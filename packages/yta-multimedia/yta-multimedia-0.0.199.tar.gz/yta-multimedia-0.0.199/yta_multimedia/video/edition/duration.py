    This mode will change the speed of the provided video to make
    it fit the needed duration by deccelerating it. As you should
    know, this method changes the whole video duration so the 
    result could be unexpected. Use it carefully.

    This mode will change the speed of the provided video to make
    it fit the needed duration by accelerating or deccelerating 
    it. This will speed up the video if the requested duration is
    shorter than the provided 'video', or will slow it down if it
    is larger. The result could be not as good as expected because
    of the speed change. Use it carefully.

    # TODO: This was thought to enlarge the video if needed and 
    # only subclip it if 'duration' was less than the real video
    # duration, but now we are able to speed it up instead of 
    # subclipping the video. Maybe we need 'enshort_mode' and
    # 'enlarge_mode' instead of only 'mode' parameter to be able
    # to chose both strategies. This will simplify the if logic
    # and make it more customizable but being solid.
