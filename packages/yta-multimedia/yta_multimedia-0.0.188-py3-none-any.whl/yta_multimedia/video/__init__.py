        Invert the received 'video' (that must be a moviepy 
        mask or normal clip) and return it inverted as a
        VideoClip. If the provided 'video' is a mask, this 
        will be also a mask.

        If the 'clip' provided is a mask clip, remember to
        set it as the new mask of your main clip.

        This inversion is a process in which the numpy array
        values of each frame are inverted by substracting the
        highest value. If the frame is an RGB frame with 
        values between 0 and 255, it will be inverted by 
        doing 255 - X on each frame pixel value. If it is
        normalized and values are between 0 and 1 (it is a 
        mask clip frame), by doing 1 - X on each mask frame
        pixel value.
