# Dynalite PDEG API

This module aims to provide an API to access the dynalite ethernet gateway (PDEG) through its telnet communication capabilities.
A backup CGI function is provided but its usage is not recommended and it may be removed in future versions

Requires asyncio and telnetlib3.

For documentation of the API, see [The dynalite docs](https://docs.dynalite.com/system-builder/latest/ethernet_gateways/integration/dynet_text.html#_telnet_access)
