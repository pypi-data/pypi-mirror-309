# For ease of dev, we use CRLF line ending as segment terminator on the HL7
# sample message. I (acv) code on windows but the github test runner run on
# Linux and checkout was converting CRLF to LF and thus segment endings got
# nuked. This will force CRLF so the CRs get retained on Linux test runners.
