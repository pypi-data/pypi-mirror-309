"""
`marlenv` is a strongly typed library for multi-agent and multi-objective reinforcement learning.

It aims to
    - provide a simple and consistent interface for reinforcement learning environments
    - provide fundamental models such as `Observation`s, `Episode`s, `Transition`s, ...
    - work with gymnasium, pettingzoo and SMAC out of the box
    - work with multi-objective environments
    - provide helpful wrappers to add intrinsic rewards, agent ids, record videos, ...
