    <h3>A Python API for the National Data Buoy Center</h3>
</div>


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's National Data Buoy Center maintains marine monitoring and observation stations around the world[^1]. These stations report atmospheric, oceanographic, and other meterological data at regular intervals to the NDBC. Measurements are made available over HTTP through the NDBC's data service.

The ndbc-api is a python library that makes this data more widely accessible.

The ndbc-api is primarily built to parse whitespace-delimited oceanographic and atmospheric data distributed as text files for available time ranges, on a station-by-station basis[^2]. Measurements are typically distributed as `utf-8` encoded, station-by-station, fixed-period text files. More information on the measurements and methodology are available [on the NDBC website](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/docs/ndbc_web_data_guide.pdf)[^3].

Please see [the included example notebook](/notebooks/overview.ipynb) for a more detailed walkthrough of the API's capabilities.

#### Installation
The `ndbc-api` can be installed via PIP:

```sh
pip install ndbc-api
```

#### Requirements
The `ndbc-api` has been tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Python 2 support is not currently planned, but could be implemented based on the needs of the atmospheric research community.

The API uses synchronous HTTP requests to compile data matching the user-supplied parameters. The `ndbc-api` package depends on:
* requests>=2.10.0
* pandas
* bs4
* html5lib>=1.1

##### Development
If you would like to contribute to the growth and maintenance of the `ndbc-api`, please feel free to open a PR with tests covering your changes. The tests leverage `pytest` and depend on the above requirements, as well as:
* coveralls
* httpretty
* pytest
* pytest-cov
* pyyaml
* pyarrow

Breaking changes will be considered, especially in the current `alpha` state of the package on `PyPi`.  As the API further matures, breaking changes will only be considered with new major versions (e.g. `N.0.0`).

#### Example

The `ndbc-api` exposes public methods through the `NdbcApi` class.

```python3
from ndbc_api import NdbcApi

api = NdbcApi()
```

The `api` is a singleton, such that the underlying `RequestHandler` and NDBC station-level `RequestCache`s are shared between instances. Both the singleton metaclass and `RequestHandler` are implemented to reduce the likelihood of repeat requests to the NDBC's data service, and to converse NDBC resources. This is balanced by a station-level `cache_limit`, implemented as an LRU cache, which seeks to respect user resources.

Data made available by the NDBC falls into two broad catagories.

1. Station metadata
2. Station measurements

The `api` supports a range of public methods for accessing data from the above catagories.

##### Station metadata

The `api` has five key public methods for accessing NDBC metadata.

1. The `stations` method, which returns all NDBC stations.
2. The `nearest_station` method, which returns the station ID of the nearest station.
3. The `station` method, which returns station metadata from a given station ID.
4. The `available_realtime` method, which returns hyperlinks and measurement names for realtime measurements captured by a given station.
5. The `available_historical` method, which returns hyperlinks and measurement names for historical measurements captured by a given station.

###### `stations`

```python3
# get all stations and some metadata as a Pandas DataFrame
stations_df = api.stations()
# parse the response as a dictionary
stations_dict = api.stations(as_df=False)
```

###### `nearest_station`

```python3
# specify desired latitude and longitude
lat = '38.88N'
lon = '76.43W'

# find the station ID of the nearest NDBC station
nearest = api.nearest_station(lat=lat, lon=lon)
print(nearest_station)
```

```python3
'tplm2'
```

###### `radial_search`

```python3
# specify desired latitude, longitude, radius, and units
lat = '38.88N'
lon = '76.43W'
radius = 100
units = 'km'

# find the station IDs of all NDBC stations within the radius
nearby_stations_df = api.radial_search(lat=lat, lon=lon, radius=radius, units=units)
```

```python3
'tplm2'
```

###### `station`

```python3
# get staion metadata
tplm2_meta = api.station(station_id='tplm2')
# parse the response as a Pandas DataFrame
tplm2_df = api.station(station_id='tplm2', as_df=True)
```

###### `available_realtime`

```python3
# get all available realtime measurements, periods, and hyperlinks
tplm2_realtime = api.available_realtime(station_id='tplm2')
# parse the response as a Pandas DataFrame
tplm2_realtime_df = api.available_realtime(station_id='tplm2', as_df=True)
```

###### `available_historical`

```python3
# get all available historical measurements, periods, and hyperlinks
tplm2_historical = api.available_historical(station_id='tplm2')
# parse the response as a Pandas DataFrame
tplm2_historical_df = api.available_historical(station_id='tplm2', as_df=True)
```

##### Station measurements

The `api` has two public method which support accessing supported NDBC station measurements.

1. The `get_modes` method, which returns a list of supported `mode`s, coresponding to the data formats provided by the NDBC data service. 

Note that not all stations provide the same set of measurements. The `available_realtime` and `available_historical` methods can be called on a station-by station basis to ensure a station has the desired data available, before building and executing requests with `get_data`. 

2. The `get_data` method, which returns measurements of a given type for a given station.

###### `get_modes`

```python3
# get the list of supported meterological measurement modes
modes = api.get_modes()
print(modes)
```

```python3
[
    'adcp',
    'cwind',
    'ocean',
    'spec',
    'stdmet',
    'supl',
    'swden',
    'swdir',
    'swdir2',
    'swr1',
    'swr2'
]
```

###### `get_data`

```python3
# get all continuous wind measurements for station tplm2
cwind_df = api.get_data(
    station_id='tplm2',
    mode='cwind',
    start_time='2020-01-01',
    end_time='2022-09-15',
)
# return data as a dictionary
cwind_dict = api.get_data(
    station_id='tplm2',
    mode='cwind',
    start_time='2020-01-01',
    end_time='2022-09-15',
    as_df=False
)
# get only the wind speed measurements
wspd_df = api.get_data(
    station_id='tplm2',
    mode='cwind',
    start_time='2020-01-01',
    end_time='2022-09-15',
    as_df=True,
    cols=['WSPD']
)
# get all standard meterological measurements for stations tplm2 and apam2
stdmet_df = api.get_data(
    station_ids=['tplm2', 'apam2'],
    mode='stdmet',
    start_time='2022-01-01',
    end_time='2023-01-01',
)
# get all (available) continuous wind and standard meterological measurements for stations tplm2 and apam2
# for station apam2, this is unavailable and will log an error but not affect the rest of the results.
stdmet_df = api.get_data(
    station_ids=['tplm2', 'apam2'],
    modes=['stdmet', 'cwind'],
    start_time='2022-01-01',
    end_time='2023-01-01',
)
```

the [GitHub discussion forum](https://github.com/cdjellen/ndbc-api/discussions).


#### Contributing
The `ndbc-api` is actively maintained, please feel free to open a pull request if you have any suggested improvements, test coverage is strongly preferred.

As a reminder, breaking changes will be considered, especially in the current `alpha` state of the package on `PyPi`.  As the API further matures, breaking changes will only be considered with new major versions (e.g. `N.0.0`).

Alternatively, if you have an idea for a new capability or improvement, feel free to open a feature request issue outlining your suggestion and the ways in which it will empower the atmospheric research community.
