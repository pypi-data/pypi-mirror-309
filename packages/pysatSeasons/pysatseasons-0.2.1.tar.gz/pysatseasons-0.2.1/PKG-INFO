pysatSeasons allows users to run seasonal data analyses over N-dimensional
data sets managed through the pysat module.

Main Features
-------------
- Seasonal binning and averaging routines for 1D and 2D distributions of nD data.
- Occurrence probability routines, daily or by orbit.
- Scatterplot of data_label(s) over two dimensions over a season.
