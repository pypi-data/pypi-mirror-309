# VoPho

VoPho is a phonemization meta-library designed to make multilingual phonemization fast, accessible, multilingual, and accurate!

## Installation

You can install VoPho via pip:

```bash
pip install VoPho
```

# Quick Start
Here's a quick example of how to use VoPho to phonemize multilingual text:

```python
from VoPho.engine import Phonemizer
from time import time

# Example input text in multiple languages
input_text = "hello, 你好は中国語でこんにちはと言う意味をしています。 Привет!"

# Instantiate the Phonemizer
engine = Phonemizer()

# Measure the time taken to phonemize
start = time()
output = engine.phonemize(input_text, output_dict=True)
end = time()
print(input_text)
engine.pretty_print(output)
print(f"Took - First: {end - start}")

# Measure the time taken for subsequent calls
start = time()
output = engine.phonemize(input_text, output_dict=True)
end = time()
print(input_text)
engine.pretty_print(output)
print(f"Took - Instantiated: {end - start}")

```

```
>>> OUTPUT: həlˈoʊ, ni˨˩˦hɑʊ˨˩˦ wa tɕɯɯgokɯ go de konnitɕiha to iɯ imi o ɕite imasɯ. prʲɪvʲ'et!
```
