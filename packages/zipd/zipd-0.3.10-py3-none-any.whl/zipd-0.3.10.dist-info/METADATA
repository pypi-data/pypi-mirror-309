- Can pass options to **zip**.
- Dry run.


## Requirements

- A [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter, version 3.10 or later

## Installing

It is recommended to install **zipd** in its own virtual environment (for example, using [uv][]).

Once you have [uv installed][uv-install], you can use it to install `zipd` as follows:

    uv tool install zipd

Then:

    uv tool run zipd --help

or:

    uvx zipd --help
