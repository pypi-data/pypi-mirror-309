Redis task queue for Python 3 heavily inspired by Celery and RQ.

Distinctive features:

- Threaded and asyncio workers
- At-least-once or at-most-once delivery per task
- Periodic tasks without an additional process
- Concurrency limits on queued jobs
- Scheduling of tasks in batch
- Integrations with `Flask, Django, Logging, Sentry and Datadog
  <https://spinach.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/integrations.html>`_
- Embeddable workers for easier testing
- See `design choices
  <https://spinach.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/design.html>`_ for more
  details

Quickstart
----------

Install Spinach with pip::

   pip install spinach

Create a task and schedule a job to be executed now:

.. code:: python

    from spinach import Engine, MemoryBroker

    spin = Engine(MemoryBroker())


    @spin.task(name='compute')
    def compute(a, b):
        print('Computed {} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))


    # Schedule a job to be executed ASAP
    spin.schedule(compute, 5, 3)

    print('Starting workers, ^C to quit')
    spin.start_workers()
