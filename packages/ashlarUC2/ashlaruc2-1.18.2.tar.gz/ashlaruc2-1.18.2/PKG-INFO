ASHLAR: Alignment by Simultaneous Harmonization of Layer/Adjacency Registration

Ashlar implements efficient combined stitching and registration of multi-channel
image mosaics collected using the Tissue-CycIF microscopy protocol [1]_. Although
originally developed for CycIF, it may also be applicable to other tiled and/or
cyclic imaging approaches. The package offers both a command line script for the
most common use cases as well as an API for building more specialized tools.

.. [1] Tissue-CycIF is multi-round immunofluorescence microscopy on large fixed
   tissue samples. See https://doi.org/10.1101/151738 for details.
