This document demonstrates how hostnames are transformed using the replacement mappings defined in the module. Each example shows the original content and the transformed content after applying the replacements from the example file `mappings.json`.

Key points:

- Encoding preservation: Encoded hostnames are correctly transformed.
- Selective replacement: Only exact hostname matches are replaced, avoiding partial or unintended substitutions.

Demonstration with verbose output: `host-replace -m mappings.json sample.txt -v`
