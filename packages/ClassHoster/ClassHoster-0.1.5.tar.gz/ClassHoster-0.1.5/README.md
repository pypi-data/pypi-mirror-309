# Host ANY Class!

## Description
Long READMEs are scary, so I'll keep this short. There is more info in the docs/README.md.
This package is meant to take YOUR class, and make it very easy to use. Do this in one terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/Repo-Factory/ClassHoster && cd ClassHoster
    install.sh && ROBOT.py

This will host the classes provided in ROBOT_SYSTEMS. 

In the second terminal

    test_class_hoster.py

You'll see some output in the 2nd terminal that will help understand why this system is helpful.

You can see generated stubs here for example class I provided.
