# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the latest minor version released. As soon as
a new minor version is released, support for the older one drops.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a security vulnerability, please contact me at
[mail@georg-krause.net](mailto:mail@georg-krause.net).
[Use GPG if possible](https://www.georg-krause.net/statics/public.key).

If the vulnerability is confirmed, I will work on a fix and a new version as
soon as possible. Since maintaining this package isn't my day job, this could
take a few days.
