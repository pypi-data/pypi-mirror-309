Tool for visualizing 3D diffraction and PDF Images.

Diffpy.fourigui is a tool to visualize and process 3D data sets written with the Python programming language.
Diffpy.fourigui always displays one slice perpendicular to one axis and allows scrolling through the 3D data set along
the given axis with a slider. It shows feedback values such as global and local maxima, minima or NAN ratios.
The matplotlib panel e.g. for zooming and saving figures is featured. Diffpy.fourigui is designed for the processing of 3D
atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). One can load a 3D reciprocal space scattering volume which can be Fourier
transformed to the 3D PDF. Thereby, one can apply cut off frequencies beyond and below given Q values, compare the
results and switch between the scattering volume in reciprocal space and 3D PDF in real space.

For more information about the diffpy.fourigui library, please consult our `online documentation <https://diffpy.github.io/diffpy.fourigui>`_.

Citation
--------

If you use diffpy.fourigui in a scientific publication, we would like you to cite this package as

        S. Y. Harouna-Mayer, S. Tao, Z. Gong, M. V. Zimmermann, D. Koziej, A.-C. Dippel, and S. J. L. Billinge,
        `Real-Space Texture and Pole-Figure Analysis Using the 3D Pair Distribution
        Function on a Platinum Thin Film <https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252522006674>`_. *IUCrJ* **9 (5)**, 594–603 (2022).

Installation
------------

The preferred method is to use `Miniconda Python
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html>`_
and install from the "conda-forge" channel of Conda packages.

To add "conda-forge" to the conda channels, run the following in a terminal. ::

        conda config --add channels conda-forge

We want to install our packages in a suitable conda environment.
The following creates and activates a new environment named ``diffpy.fourigui_env`` ::

        conda create -n diffpy.fourigui_env diffpy.fourigui
        conda activate diffpy.fourigui_env

To confirm that the installation was successful, type ::

        python -c "import diffpy.fourigui; print(diffpy.fourigui.__version__)"

The output should print the latest version displayed on the badges above.

If the above does not work, you can use ``pip`` to download and install the latest release from
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org>`_.
To install using ``pip`` into your ``diffpy.fourigui_env`` environment, type ::

        pip install diffpy.fourigui

If you prefer to install from sources, after installing the dependencies, obtain the source archive from
`GitHub <https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.fourigui/>`_. Once installed, ``cd`` into your ``diffpy.fourigui`` directory
and run the following ::

        pip install .

Getting Started
---------------

You may consult our `online documentation <https://diffpy.github.io/diffpy.fourigui>`_ for tutorials and API references.

Support and Contribute
----------------------

`Diffpy user group <https://groups.google.com/g/diffpy-users>`_ is the discussion forum for general questions and discussions about the use of diffpy.fourigui. Please join the diffpy.fourigui users community by joining the Google group. The diffpy.fourigui project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!

If you see a bug or want to request a feature, please `report it as an issue <https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.fourigui/issues>`_ and/or `submit a fix as a PR <https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.fourigui/pulls>`_. You can also post it to the `Diffpy user group <https://groups.google.com/g/diffpy-users>`_.

Feel free to fork the project and contribute. To install diffpy.fourigui
in a development mode, with its sources being directly used by Python
rather than copied to a package directory, use the following in the root
directory ::

        pip install -e .

To ensure code quality and to prevent accidental commits into the default branch, please set up the use of our pre-commit
hooks.

1. Install pre-commit in your working environment by running ``conda install pre-commit``.

2. Initialize pre-commit (one time only) ``pre-commit install``.

Thereafter your code will be linted by black and isort and checked against flake8 before you can commit.
If it fails by black or isort, just rerun and it should pass (black and isort will modify the files so should
pass after they are modified). If the flake8 test fails please see the error messages and fix them manually before
trying to commit again.

Improvements and fixes are always appreciated.
