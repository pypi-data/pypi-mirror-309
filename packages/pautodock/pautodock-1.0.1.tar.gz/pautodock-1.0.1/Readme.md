# PAutodock - Parallelize AutoDock JOBs

PAutodock is a powerful set of scripts designed to parallelize AutoDock jobs, enabling fast screening across multiple CPUs. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and scientists working in computational biology and drug discovery, allowing them to efficiently manage and execute docking simulations.

## Installation

Install from pip

```
pip install pautodock
```

or clone and install from source

```
git clone https://github.com/gmrandazzo/PAutoDock.git
cd PAutoDock
poetry install
```

## Usage

To use PAutodock for parallelizing AutoDock jobs, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Receptor and Ligand**:
   - Ensure you have a receptor file (in PDB format) that represents the target protein or enzyme.
   - Prepare a ligand file (also in PDB format) that contains the molecule you want to dock with the receptor.

2. **Create a Multimol2 File**:
   - Prepare a multimol2 file that includes all the ligands you wish to screen.
   - Each ligand in the file must have:
     - **Partial Charges**: Ensure that the ligands have Gasteiger partial charges assigned.
     - **3D Coordinates**: The ligands should be represented in 3D space.
     - **Unique Names**: Each molecule must have a unique name to avoid conflicts during the screening process.

3. **Execute the Command**:
   - Once your receptor and multimol2 file are ready, execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   cd data/3EML
   pautodock --receptor rec.pdb --cx -9.06364 --cy -7.1446 --cz 55.8626 --db dataset.mol2 --wdir example_calculation --out screening_results.csv --vina ON --atd OFF
