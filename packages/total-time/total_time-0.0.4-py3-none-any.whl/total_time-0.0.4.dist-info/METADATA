# total_time Module

The **total_time** module provides a simple way to measure elapsed time in your Python programs. It includes functions to start a timer, stop it, and calculate the total elapsed time.

## Functions

### `start()`
This function initializes the timer by recording the current time. Call this function when you want to start measuring time.

### `end()`
This function stops the timer by recording the current time as the end time. If you haven't called `start()` before calling `end()`, this function will not work correctly.

### `total()`
This function calculates and returns the total elapsed time in seconds from when `start()` was called to when `end()` was called. 
- If `end()` has not been called yet, it will automatically call `end()` before calculating the total time.

### `ttotal()`
This function prints a message indicating how long the operation took. The message will state:
total = total elapsed time in seconds from when `start()` was called to when `end()` was called
"It took the computer {total} seconds." 

- If you have not called `end()` before using this function, it will automatically call `end()` first to ensure accurate timing.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the total_time module:

```python
import total_time

start()
# ... your code here ...
end()
ttotal()
