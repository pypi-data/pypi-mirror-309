# hoymiles-wifi

This Python library facilitates communication with Hoymiles DTUs and the HMS-XXXXW-2T HMS microinverters, utilizing protobuf messages.

For the Home Assistant integration have a look here:

**Disclaimer: This library is not affiliated with Hoymiles. It is an independent project developed to provide tools for interacting with Hoymiles HMS-XXXXW series micro-inverters featuring integrated WiFi DTU. Any trademarks or product names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.**

## Supported Devices

The library was successfully tested with:

- Hoymiles HMS-400W-1T
- Hoymiles HMS-800W-2T
- Hoymiles DTU-WLite
- Hoymiles DTU-Pro

## Installation

```
$ pip install hoymiles-wifi
```

## Usage

You can integrate the library into your own project, or simply use it in the command line.

### Command line:

```
hoymiles-wifi [-h] --host HOST [--local_addr IP_OF_INTERFACE_TO_USE] [--as-json] <command>

commands:
    get-real-data-new,
    get-real-data-hms,
    get-real-data,
    get-config,
    network-info,
    app-information-data,
    app-get-hist-power,
    set-power-limit,
    set-wifi,
    firmware-update,
    restart-dtu,
    turn-on-inverter,
    turn-off-inverter,
    get-information-data,
    get-version-info,
    heartbeat,
    identify-dtu,
    identify-inverters,
    identify-meters,

The `--as-json` option is optional and allows formatting the output as JSON.
```

### Python code

```
from hoymiles_wifi.dtu import DTU
...
dtu = DTU(<ip_address>)
response = await dtu.<command>

if response:
    print(f"DTU Response: {response}")
else:
    print("Unable to get response!")
```

#### Available functions

- `async_get_information_data()`: Retrieve information data
- `async_heartbeat()`: Request a heartbeat message from the DTU

## Note

Please be aware of the following considerations:

- No DTU Implementation: This library retrieves information directly from the (internal) DTU of Hoymiles Wifi inverters.

## Caution

Use this library responsibly and be aware of potential risks. There are no guarantees provided, and any misuse or incorrect implementation may result in undesirable outcomes. Ensure that your inverter is not compromised during communication.

## Known Limitations

**Update Frequency:** The library may experience limitations in fetching updates, potentially around twice per minute. The inverter firmware may enforce a mandatory wait period of approximately 30 seconds between requests.

**Compatibility:** While developed for the HMS-800W-2T inverter, compatibility with other inverters from the series is untested at the time of writing. Exercise caution and conduct thorough testing if using with different inverter models.
