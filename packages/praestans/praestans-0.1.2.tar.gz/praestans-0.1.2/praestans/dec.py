def decimal_to_binray(number):
    """
    Converts a decimal (base-10) number to its binary (base-2) representation.

    Parameters:
        number (int | str): The decimal number to convert.

    Returns:
        int: An integer representing the binary equivalent of the input number.

    Example:
        decimal_to_binary(11) -> 1011

    How it works:
        Divide the number by 2 until it becomes 0, and recod the remainder at each step.
        Reverse the remainders to obtain the binary number.

        int: An integer representing the octal equivalent of the input number.

    Example:

        str: A string representing the hexadecimal equivalent of the input number.

    Example:
