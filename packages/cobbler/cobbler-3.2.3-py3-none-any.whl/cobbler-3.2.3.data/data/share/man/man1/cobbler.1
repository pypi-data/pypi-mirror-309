.SH GENERAL PRINCIPLES
.sp
This should just be a brief overview. For the detailed explanations please refer to
\fI\%Readthedocs\fP\&.
.SS Distros, Profiles and Systems
.sp
Cobbler has a system of inheritance when it comes to managing the information you want to apply to a certain system.
.SS Images
.SS Repositories
.SS Management Classes
.SS Deleting configuration entries
.sp
If you want to remove a specific object, use the remove command with the name that was used to add it.

.SS Editing
.sp
If you want to change a particular setting without doing an \fBadd\fP again, use the \fBedit\fP command, using the same name
you gave when you added the item. Anything supplied in the parameter list will overwrite the settings in the existing
object, preserving settings not mentioned.

.SS Cobbler distro
.sp
This first step towards configuring what you want to install is to add a distribution record to Cobbler\(aqs configuration.
.sp
If there is an rsync mirror, DVD, NFS, or filesystem tree available that you would rather \fBimport\fP instead, skip down
to the documentation about the \fBimport\fP command. It\(aqs really a lot easier to follow the import workflow \-\- it only
requires waiting for the mirror content to be copied and/or scanned. Imported mirrors also save time during install
since they don\(aqt have to hit external install sources.
.sp
If you want to be explicit with distribution definition, however, here\(aqs how it works:

T{
arch
T}	T{
Sets the architecture for the PXE bootloader and also controls how Koan\(aqs \fB\-\-replace\-self\fP option
will operate.
.sp
The default setting (\fBstandard\fP) will use \fBpxelinux\fP\&. Set to \fBppc\fP and \fBppc64\fP to use
\fByaboot\fP\&.
.sp
\fBx86\fP and \fBx86_64\fP effectively do the same thing as standard.
.sp
If you perform a \fBcobbler import\fP, the arch field will be auto\-assigned.
T}

T{
autoinstall\-
meta
T}	T{
This is an advanced feature that sets automatic installation template variables to substitute, thus
enabling those files to be treated as templates. Templates are powered using Cheetah and are
described further along in this manpage as well as on the Cobbler Wiki.
.sp
Example: \fB\-\-autoinstall\-meta="foo=bar baz=3 asdf"\fP
.sp
See the section on "Kickstart Templating" for further information.

Boot loader (Network installation boot loader).
Valid options are <<inherit>>, \fIgrub\fP, \fIpxelinux\fP, \fIyaboot\fP, \fIipxe\fP\&.
T}
_
T{
breed
T}	T{
Controls how various physical and virtual parameters, including kernel arguments for automatic
installation, are to be treated. Defaults to \fBredhat\fP, which is a suitable value for Fedora and
CentOS as well. It means anything Red Hat based.
.sp
There is limited experimental support for specifying "debian", "ubuntu", or "suse", which treats the
automatic installation template file as a preseed/autoyast file format and changes the kernel
arguments appropriately. Support for other types of distributions is possible in the future. See the
Wiki for the latest information about support for these distributions.
.sp
The file used for the answer file, regardless of the breed setting, is the value used for
\fB\-\-autoinstall\fP when creating the profile.

T{
\fBkernel\fP
T}	T{
An absolute filesystem path to a kernel image.
T}
_
T{
kernel\-options
T}	T{
Sets kernel command\-line arguments that the distro, and profiles/systems depending on it, will use.
To remove a kernel argument that may be added by a higher Cobbler object (or in the global
settings), you can prefix it with a \fB!\fP\&.
.sp
Example: \fB\-\-kernel\-options="foo=bar baz=3 asdf !gulp"\fP
.sp
This example passes the arguments \fBfoo=bar baz=3 asdf\fP but will make sure \fBgulp\fP is not passed
even if it was requested at a level higher up in the Cobbler configuration.
T}

T{
kernel\-options\-
post
T}	T{
This is just like \fB\-\-kernel\-options\fP, though it governs kernel options on the installed OS, as
opposed to kernel options fed to the installer. The syntax is exactly the same. This requires some
special snippets to be found in your automatic installation template in order for this to work.
Automatic installation templating is described later on in this document.

T}	T{
A string identifying the distribution, this should be something like \fBrhel6\fP\&.
T}
_
T{
os\-version
T}	T{
Generally this field can be ignored. It is intended to alter some hardware setup for virtualized
instances when provisioning guests with Koan. The valid options for \fB\-\-os\-version\fP vary depending
on what is specified for \fB\-\-breed\fP\&. If you specify an invalid option, the error message will
contain a list of valid OS versions that can be used. If you don\(aqt know the OS version or it does
not appear in the list, omitting this argument or using \fBother\fP should be perfectly fine. If you
don\(aqt encounter any problems with virtualized instances, this option can be safely ignored.
T}
_
T{
owners
T}	T{
Users with small sites and a limited number of admins can probably ignore this option. All Cobbler
objects (distros, profiles, systems, and repos) can take a \-\-owners parameter to specify what
Cobbler users can edit particular objects.This only applies to the Cobbler WebUI and XML\-RPC
interface, not the "cobbler" command line tool run from the shell. Furthermore, this is only
respected by the \fBauthz_ownership\fP module which must be enabled in \fB/etc/cobbler/modules.conf\fP\&.
The value for \fB\-\-owners\fP is a space separated list of users and groups as specified in
\fB/etc/cobbler/users.conf\fP\&. For more information see the users.conf file as well as the Cobbler
Wiki. In the default Cobbler configuration, this value is completely ignored, as is \fBusers.conf\fP\&.

Management Classes (Management classes for external config management).
T}

T{
remote\-boot\-
kernel
T}	T{
A URL pointing to the installation initrd of a distribution. If the bootloader has this support,
it will directly download the kernel from this URL, instead of the directory of the TFTP client.
Note: The kernel (or initrd below) will still be copied into the image directory of the TFTP server.
The above kernel parameter is still needed (e.g. to build iso images, etc.).
The advantage of letting the boot loader retrieve the kernel/initrd directly is the support of
changing/updated distributions. E.g. openSUSE Tumbleweed is updated on the fly and if Cobbler would
copy/cache the kernel/initrd in the TFTP directory, you would get a "kernel does not match
distribution" (or similar) error when trying to install.
T}

T{
template\-files
T}	T{
This feature allows Cobbler to be used as a configuration management system. The argument is a space
delimited string of \fBkey=value\fP pairs. Each key is the path to a template file, each value is the
path to install the file on the system. This is described in further detail on the Cobbler Wiki and
is implemented using special code in the post install. Koan also can retrieve these files from a
Cobbler server on demand, effectively allowing Cobbler to function as a lightweight templated
configuration management system.

.TE
.SS Cobbler profile
.sp
A profile associates a distribution to additional specialized options, such as a installation automation file. Profiles
are the core unit of provisioning and at least one profile must exist for every distribution to be provisioned. A
profile might represent, for instance, a web server or desktop configuration. In this way, profiles define a role to be
performed.

This is an advanced feature.
.sp
Profiles may inherit from other profiles in lieu of specifying \fB\-\-distro\fP\&. Inherited profiles
will override any settings specified in their parent, with the exception of
\fB\-\-autoinstall\-meta\fP (templating) and \fB\-\-kernel\-options\fP (kernel options), which will be
blended together.
.sp
Example: If profile A has \fB\-\-kernel\-options="x=7 y=2"\fP, B inherits from A, and B has
\fB\-\-kernel\-options="x=9 z=2"\fP, the actual kernel options that will be used for B are
\fBx=9 y=2 z=2\fP\&.

as shipped in the RPM is \fBxenbr0\fP\&. If using KVM, this is most likely not correct. You may
want to override this setting in the system object. Bridge settings are important as they
define how outside networking will reach the guest. For more information on bridge setup, see
the Cobbler Wiki, where there is a section describing Koan usage.

T}
_
T{
virt\-file\-size
T}	T{
(Virt\-only) How large the disk image should be in Gigabytes. The default is 5. This can be a
comma separated list (ex: \fB5,6,7\fP) to allow for multiple disks of different sizes depending
on what is given to \fB\-\-virt\-path\fP\&. This should be input as a integer or decimal value without
units.
T}
_
T{
virt\-path
T}	T{
(Virt\-only) Where to store the virtual image on the host system. Except for advanced cases,
this parameter can usually be omitted. For disk images, the value is usually an absolute path
to an existing directory with an optional filename component. There is support for specifying
partitions \fB/dev/sda4\fP or volume groups \fBVolGroup00\fP, etc.
.sp
For multiple disks, separate the values with commas such as \fBVolGroup00,VolGroup00\fP or
\fB/dev/sda4,/dev/sda5\fP\&. Both those examples would create two disks for the VM.
T}

virt\-type
T}	T{
(Virt\-only) Koan can install images using either Xen paravirt (\fBxenpv\fP) or QEMU/KVM
(\fBqemu\fP). Choose one or the other strings to specify, or values will default to attempting to
find a compatible installation type on the client system("auto"). See the "Koan" manpage for
more documentation. The default \fB\-\-virt\-type\fP can be configured in the Cobbler settings file
such that this parameter does not have to be provided. Other virtualization types are
supported, for information on those options (such as VMware), see the Cobbler Wiki.

.TE
.SS Cobbler system
.sp
System records map a piece of hardware (or a virtual machine) with the Cobbler profile to be assigned to run on it. This
may be thought of as choosing a role for a specific system.
.sp
Note that if provisioning via Koan and PXE menus alone, it is not required to create system records in Cobbler, though
they are useful when system specific customizations are required. One such customization would be defining the MAC
address. If there is a specific role intended for a given machine, system records should be created for it.
.sp
System commands have a wider variety of control offered over network details. In order to use these to the fullest
possible extent, the automatic installation template used by Cobbler must contain certain automatic installation
snippets (sections of code specifically written for Cobbler to make these values become reality). Compare your automatic
installation templates with the stock ones in /var/lib/cobbler/templates if you have upgraded, to make sure
you can take advantage of all options to their fullest potential. If you are a new Cobbler user, base your automatic
installation templates off of these templates.

While it is recommended that the \fB\-\-autoinstall\fP parameter is only used within for the

may have legacy automatic installation files created on aper\-system basis (one automatic
installation file for each system, nothing shared) and may not want to immediately make use of
the Cobbler templating system. This allows specifying a automatic installation file for use on
a per\-system basis. Creation of a parent profile is still required. If the automatic

T}	T{
If you are setting up a PXE environment with multiple subnets/gateways, and are using Cobbler
to manage a DHCP configuration, you will probably want to use this option. If not, it can be
ignored.
.sp
By default, the dhcp tag for all systems is "default" and means that in the DHCP template
files the systems will expand out where $insert_cobbler_systems_definitions is found in the
DHCP template. However, you may want certain systems to expand out in other places in the DHCP
config file. Setting \fB\-\-dhcp\-tag=subnet2\fP for instance, will cause that system to expand out
where $insert_cobbler_system_definitions_subnet2 is found, allowing you to insert directives
to specify different subnets (or other parameters) before the DHCP configuration entries for
those particular systems.

Netmask is a per\-interface parameter. Because of the way gateway is stored on the installed OS,
gateway is a global parameter. You may use \fB\-\-static\-routes\fP for per\-interface customizations

By default flags like \fB\-\-ip\fP, \fB\-\-mac\fP, \fB\-\-dhcp\-tag\fP, \fB\-\-dns\-name\fP, \fB\-\-netmask\fP,
\fB\-\-virt\-bridge\fP, and \fB\-\-static\-routes\fP operate on the first network interface defined for
a system (eth0).
However, Cobbler supports an arbitrary number of interfaces. Using \fB\-\-interface=eth1\fP for
instance, will allow creating and editing of a second interface.
.sp
Interface naming notes:
.sp
Additional interfaces can be specified (for example: eth1, or any name you like, as long as it
does not conflict with any reserved names such as kernel module names) for use with the edit
command. Defining VLANs this way is also supported, of you want to add VLAN 5 on interface
eth0, simply name your interface eth0.5.
.sp
Example:
.sp
cobbler system edit \-\-name=foo \-\-ip\-address=192.168.1.50 \-\-mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:A0
.sp
cobbler system edit \-\-name=foo \-\-interface=eth0 \-\-ip\-address=10.1.1.51 \-\-mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:A1
.sp
cobbler system report foo

T}	T{
One of the other advanced networking features supported by Cobbler is NIC bonding, bridging
and BMC. You can use this to bond multiple physical network interfaces to one single logical
interface to reduce single points of failure in your network, to create bridged interfaces for
things like tunnels and virtual machine networks, or to manage BMC interface by DHCP.
Supported values for the \fB\-\-interface\-type\fP parameter are "bond", "bond_slave", "bridge",
"bridge_slave","bonded_bridge_slave" and "bmc". If one of the "_slave" options is specified,
you also need to define the master\-interface for this bond using
\fB\-\-interface\-master=INTERFACE\fP\&. Bonding and bridge options for the master\-interface may be
specified using \fB\-\-bonding\-opts="foo=1 bar=2"\fP or \fB\-\-bridge\-opts="foo=1 bar=2"\fP\&.

If you are using static IP configurations and have multiple interfaces, use this to define
different gateway for each interface.
.sp
This is a per\-interface setting.
T}
_
T{
ip\-address,
ipv6\-address
T}	T{
If Cobbler is configured to generate a DHCP configuration (see advanced section), use this
setting to define a specific IP for this system in DHCP. Leaving off this parameter will
result in no DHCP management for this particular system.
.sp
Example: \fB\-\-ip\-address=192.168.1.50\fP
.sp
If DHCP management is disabled and the interface is labelled \fB\-\-static=1\fP, this setting will
be used for static IP configuration.
.sp
Special feature: To control the default PXE behavior for an entire subnet, this field can also
be passed in using CIDR notation. If \fB\-\-ip\fP is CIDR, do not specify any other arguments
other than \fB\-\-name\fP and \fB\-\-profile\fP\&.
.sp
When using the CIDR notation trick, don\(aqt specify any arguments other than \fB\-\-name\fP and
\fB\-\-profile\fP, as they won\(aqt be used.
T}
_
T{
kernel\-options
T}	T{
Sets kernel command\-line arguments that the distro, and profiles/systems depending on it, will
use. To remove a kernel argument that may be added by a higher Cobbler object (or in the global
settings), you can prefix it with a \fB!\fP\&.
.sp
Example: \fB\-\-kernel\-options="foo=bar baz=3 asdf !gulp"\fP
.sp
This example passes the arguments \fBfoo=bar baz=3 asdf\fP but will make sure \fBgulp\fP is not
passed even if it was requested at a level higher up in the Cobbler configuration.
T}
_
T{
kernel\-options\-post
T}	T{
This is just like \fB\-\-kernel\-options\fP, though it governs kernel options on the installed OS,
as opposed to kernel options fed to the installer. The syntax is exactly the same. This
requires some special snippets to be found in your automatic installation template in order
for this to work. Automatic installation templating is described later on in this document.
.sp
Example: \fBnoapic\fP
T}
_
T{
mac,
mac\-address
T}	T{
Specifying a mac address via \fB\-\-mac\fP allows the system object to boot directly to a specific
profile via PXE, bypassing Cobbler\(aqs PXE menu. If the name of the Cobbler system already looks
like a mac address, this is inferred from the system name and does not need to be specified.
.sp
MAC addresses have the format AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. It\(aqs highly recommended to register your MAC
addresses in Cobbler if you\(aqre using static addressing with multiple interfaces, or if you are
using any of the advanced networking features like bonding, bridges or VLANs.
.sp
Cobbler does contain a feature (enabled in /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml) that can automatically
add new system records when it finds profiles being provisioned on hardware it has seen before.
This may help if you do not have a report of all the MAC addresses in your datacenter/lab
configuration.

T}
_
T{
\fBname\fP
T}	T{
The system name works like the name option for other commands.
.sp
If the name looks like a MAC address or an IP, the name will implicitly be used for either
\fB\-\-mac\fP or \fB\-\-ip\fP of the first interface, respectively. However, it\(aqs usually better to
give a descriptive name \-\- don\(aqt rely on this behavior.
.sp
A system created with name "default" has special semantics. If a default system object exists,
it sets all undefined systems to PXE to a specific profile. Without a "default" system name
created, PXE will fall through to local boot for unconfigured systems.
.sp
When using "default" name, don\(aqt specify any other arguments than \fB\-\-profile\fP, as they won\(aqt
be used.
T}
_
T{
name\-servers
T}	T{
If your nameservers are not provided by DHCP, you can specify a space separated list of
addresses here to configure each of the installed nodes to use them (provided the automatic
installation files used are installed on a per\-system basis). Users with DHCP setups should not
need to use this option. This is available to set in profiles to avoid having to set it
repeatedly for each system record.
T}
_
T{
name\-servers\-search
T}	T{
You can specify a space separated list of domain names to configure each of the installed nodes
to use them as domain search path. This is available to set in profiles to avoid having to set
it repeatedly for each system record.
T}
_
T{
netboot\-enabled
T}	T{
If set false, the system will be provisionable through Koan but not through standard PXE.
This will allow the system to fall back to default PXE boot behavior without deleting the
Cobbler system object. The default value allows PXE. Cobbler contains a PXE boot loop
prevention feature (pxe_just_once, can be enabled in /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml) that can
automatically trip off this value after a system gets done installing. This can prevent
installs from appearing in an endless loop when the system is set to PXE first in the BIOS
order.

Users with small sites and a limited number of admins can probably ignore this option. All

Cobbler users can edit particular objects.This only applies to the Cobbler WebUI and XML\-RPC
interface, not the "cobbler" command line tool run from the shell. Furthermore, this is only
respected by the \fBauthz_ownership\fP module which must be enabled in
\fB/etc/cobbler/modules.conf\fP\&. The value for \fB\-\-owners\fP is a space separated list of users
and groups as specified in \fB/etc/cobbler/users.conf\fP\&.
For more information see the users.conf file as well as the Cobbler
Wiki. In the default Cobbler configuration, this value is completely ignored, as is

.sp
For multiple disks, separate the values with commas such as \fBVolGroup00,VolGroup00\fP or

.SS Cobbler repo

Repository mirroring allows Cobbler to mirror not only install trees ("cobbler import" does this for you) but also
optional packages, 3rd party content, and even updates. Mirroring all of this content locally on your network will
result in faster, more up\-to\-date installations and faster updates. If you are only provisioning a home setup, this will
probably be overkill, though it can be very useful for larger setups (labs, datacenters, etc).

.sp
The mirror address should specify an exact repository to mirror \-\- just one architecture and just
one distribution. If you have a separate repo to mirror for a different arch, add that repo
separately.
.sp
Here\(aqs an example of what looks like a good URL:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
Experimental support is also provided for mirroring RHN content when you need a fast local mirror.
The mirror syntax for this is \fB\-\-mirror=rhn://channel\-name\fP and you must have entitlements for
this to work. This requires the Cobbler server to be installed on RHEL 5 or later. You will also
need a version of \fByum\-utils\fP equal or greater to 1.0.4.
T}

mirror urls are supported when using \fB\-\-mirror\-locally=N\fP, you cannot use filesystem URLs.
T}
_
T{
\fBname\fP
T}	T{
This name is used as the save location for the mirror. If the mirror represented, say, Fedora
Core 6 i386 updates, a good name would be \fBfc6i386updates\fP\&. Again, be specific.
.sp
This name corresponds with values given to the \fB\-\-repos\fP parameter of \fBcobbler profile add\fP\&.
If a profile has a \fB\-\-repos\fP\-value that matches the name given here, that repo can be
automatically set up during provisioning (when supported) and installed systems will also use the
boot server as a mirror (unless \fByum_post_install_mirror\fP is disabled in the settings file). By
default the provisioning server will act as a mirror to systems it installs, which may not be
desirable for laptop configurations, etc.
.sp
Distros that can make use of yum repositories during automatic installation include FC6 and later,
RHEL 5 and later, and derivative distributions.

.SS Cobbler replicate
.sp
Cobbler can replicate configurations from a master Cobbler server. Each Cobbler server is still expected to have a
locally relevant \fB/etc/cobbler/cobbler.conf\fP and \fBmodules.conf\fP, as these files are not synced.
.sp
This feature is intended for load\-balancing, disaster\-recovery, backup, or multiple geography support.
.sp
Cobbler can replicate data from a central server.
.sp
Objects that need to be replicated should be specified with a pattern, such as \fB\-\-profiles="webservers* dbservers*"\fP
or \fB\-\-systems="*.example.org"\fP\&. All objects matched by the pattern, and all dependencies of those objects matched by
the pattern (recursively) will be transferred from the remote server to the central server. This is to say if you intend
to transfer \fB*.example.org\fP and the definition of the systems have not changed, but a profile above them has changed,
the changes to that profile will also be transferred.
.sp
In the case where objects are more recent on the local server, those changes will not be overridden locally.
.sp
Common data locations will be rsync\(aqed from the master server unless \fB\-\-omit\-data\fP is specified.
.sp
To delete objects that are no longer present on the master server, use \fB\-\-prune\fP\&.
.sp
\fBWarning\fP: This will delete all object types not present on the remote server from the local server, and is recursive.
If you use prune, it is best to manage Cobbler centrally and not expect changes made on the slave servers to be
preserved. It is not currently possible to just prune objects of a specific type.

Cobbler reposync is the command to use to update repos as configured with \fBcobbler repo add\fP\&. Mirroring can
take a long time, and usage of cobbler reposync prior to usage is needed to ensure provisioned systems have the
files they need to actually use the mirrored repositories. If you just add repos and never run \fBcobbler reposync\fP,
the repos will never be mirrored. This is probably a command you would want to put on a crontab, though the
frequency of that crontab and where the output goes is left up to the systems administrator.
.sp
For those familiar with dnf’s reposync, cobbler’s reposync is (in most uses) a wrapper around the \fBdnf reposync\fP
command. Please use \fBcobbler reposync\fP to update cobbler mirrors, as dnf’s reposync does not perform all required steps.
Also cobbler adds support for rsync and SSH locations, where as dnf’s reposync only supports what dnf supports
(http/ftp).
.sp
If you ever want to update a certain repository you can run:
\fBcobbler reposync \-\-only="reponame1" ...\fP
.sp
When updating repos by name, a repo will be updated even if it is set to be not updated during a regular reposync
operation (ex: \fBcobbler repo edit –name=reponame1 –keep\-updated=0\fP).
Note that if a cobbler import provides enough information to use the boot server as a yum mirror for core packages,
cobbler can set up automatic installation files to use the cobbler server as a mirror instead of the outside world. If
this feature is desirable, it can be turned on by \fBsetting yum_post_install_mirror\fP to \fBTrue\fP in
\fB/etc/cobbler/settings.yaml\fP (and running \fBcobbler sync\fP). You should not use this feature if machines are
provisioned on a different VLAN/network than production, or if you are provisioning laptops that will want to acquire
updates on multiple networks.
.sp
The flags \fB\-\-tries=N\fP (for example, \fB\-\-tries=3\fP) and \fB\-\-no\-fail\fP should likely be used when putting re\-posync on a
crontab. They ensure network glitches in one repo can be retried and also that a failure to synchronize one repo does
not stop other repositories from being synchronized.
.SS Cobbler sync
.sp
The sync command is very important, though very often unnecessary for most situations. It\(aqs primary purpose is to force
a rewrite of all configuration files, distribution files in the TFTP root, and to restart managed services. So why is it
unnecessary? Because in most common situations (after an object is edited, for example), Cobbler executes what is known
as a "lite sync" which rewrites most critical files.
.sp
When is a full sync required? When you are using \fBmanage_dhcpd\fP (Managing DHCP) with systems that use static leases.
In that case, a full sync is required to rewrite the \fBdhcpd.conf\fP file and to restart the dhcpd service.
.sp
Cobbler sync is used to repair or rebuild the contents \fB/tftpboot\fP or \fB/var/www/cobbler\fP when something has changed
behind the scenes. It brings the filesystem up to date with the configuration as understood by Cobbler.
.sp
Sync should be run whenever files in \fB/var/lib/cobbler\fP are manually edited (which is not recommended except for the
settings file) or when making changes to automatic installation files. In practice, this should not happen often, though
running sync too many times does not cause any adverse effects.
.sp
If using Cobbler to manage a DHCP and/or DNS server (see the advanced section of this manpage), sync does need to be run
after systems are added to regenerate and reload the DHCP/DNS configurations.
.sp
The sync process can also be kicked off from the web interface.

.SH ADDITIONAL HELP
.sp
We have a Gitter Channel and you also can ask questions as GitHub issues. The IRC Channel on Freenode (#cobbler) is not
that active but sometimes there are people who can help you.
.sp
The way we would prefer are GitHub issues as they are easily searchable.
