There are two main settings files which are located per default at \fB/etc/cobbler/\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The file \fBsettings.yaml\fP is following \fI\%YAML\fP specification.
.IP \(bu 2
The file \fBmodules.conf\fP is following
\fI\%INI\fP specification.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Since we are cleaning a lot of tech\-debt this may change over time. We are trying to find the balance which
format is the best for us to handle in the code and the best for admins to handle in the config files.

.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you are using \fBallow_dynamic_settings\fP, then the comments in the YAML file will vanish after the first
change due to the fact that PyYAML doesn\(aqt support comments
(\fI\%Source\fP)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There are additional configuration file locations which need to follow the YAML Syntax. These are loaded from the
\fBinclude\fP directory in the \fBsettings.yaml\fP file. Any key specified in one of these files overwrites values from the
main file.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When using \fBallow_dynamic_settings\fP the values are only persisted in the file \fBsettings.yaml\fP\&. This
may lead to a non expected behaviour after \fBcobblerd\fP restarts. This is a
\fI\%known issue\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH UPDATES TO THE YAML-SETTINGS-FILE
.sp
Starting with 3.2.1:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
We require the extension \fB\&.yaml\fP on our settings file to indicate the format of the file to editors and comply to
standards of the YAML specification.
.IP \(bu 2
We require the usage of booleans in the format of \fBTrue\fP and \fBFalse\fP\&. If you have old integer style booleans with
\fB1\fP and \fB0\fP this is fine but you may should convert them as soon as possible. We may decide in a future version to
enforce our new way in a stricter manner. Automatic conversion is only done on a best\-effort/available\-resources
basis.
.IP \(bu 2
We enforce the types of values to the keys. Additional unexpected keys will throw errors. If you have those used in
Cobbler please report this in our issue tracker. We have decided to go this way to be able to rely on the existence
of the values. This gives us the freedom to write less access checks to the settings without loosing stability.
.UNINDENT
.SH SETTINGS.YAML
.SS allow_duplicate_hostnames
.sp
If \fBTrue\fP, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the \fB\-\-dns\-name\fP information of other
system records. In general, this is undesirable and should be left False.
.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS allow_duplicate_ips
.sp
If \fBTrue\fP, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the IP address information of other system
records. In general, this is undesirable and should be left False.
.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS allow_duplicate_macs
.sp
If \fBTrue\fP, Cobbler will allow insertions of system records that duplicate the mac address information of other system
records. In general, this is undesirable.
.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS allow_dynamic_settings
.sp
If \fBTrue\fP, Cobbler will allow settings to be changed dynamically without a restart of the \fBcobblerd\fP daemon. You can
only change this variable by manually editing the settings file, and you MUST restart \fBcobblerd\fP after changing it.

.sp
Always write DHCP entries, regardless if netboot is enabled.
.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS anamon_enabled
.sp
By default, installs are \fInot\fP set to send installation logs to the Cobbler server. With \fBanamon_enabled\fP, automatic
installation templates may use the \fBpre_anamon\fP snippet to allow remote live monitoring of their installations from
the Cobbler server. Installation logs will be stored under \fB/var/log/cobbler/anamon/\fP\&.
.sp

Used for caching the intermediate files for ISO\-Building. You may want to use a SSD, a tmpfs or something which does not
persist across reboots and can be easily thrown away but is also fast.
.sp
default: \fB/var/cache/cobbler/buildiso\fP
.SS cache_enabled
.sp
If \fBcache_enabled\fP is \fBTrue\fP, a cache will keep converted records in memory to make checking them faster. This helps
with use cases like writing out large numbers of records. There is a known issue with cache and remote XML\-RPC API
calls. If you will use Cobbler with config management or infrastructure\-as\-code tools such as Terraform, it is
recommended to disable by setting to \fBFalse\fP\&.
.sp
default: \fBTrue\fP
.SS cheetah_import_whitelist
.sp
Cheetah\-language autoinstall templates can import Python modules. while this is a useful feature, it is not safe to
allow them to import anything they want. This whitelists which modules can be imported through Cheetah. Users can expand
this as needed but should never allow modules such as subprocess or those that allow access to the filesystem as Cheetah
templates are evaluated by \fBcobblerd\fP as code.

controls what install (root) password is set up for those systems that reference this variable. The factory default is
"cobbler" and Cobbler check will warn if this is not changed. The simplest way to change the password is to run

.SS default_template_type
.sp
The default template type to use in the absence of any other detected template. If you do not specify the template
with \fB#template=<template_type>\fP on the first line of your templates/snippets, Cobbler will assume try to use the
following template engine to parse the templates.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Over time we will try to deprecate and remove Cheetah3 as a template engine. It is hard to package and there
are fewer guides then with Jinja2. Making the templating independent of the engine is a task which complicates
the code. Thus, please try to use Jinja2. We will try to support a seamless transition on a best\-effort basis.

For libvirt based installs in Koan, if no virt\-bridge is specified, which bridge do we try? For EL 4/5 hosts this should
be \fBxenbr0\fP, for all versions of Fedora, try \fBvirbr0\fP\&. This can be overridden on a per\-profile basis or at the Koan
command line though this saves typing to just set it here to the most common option.

.SS pxe_just_once
.sp
If this setting is set to \fBTrue\fP, Cobbler systems that pxe boot will request at the end of their installation to
toggle the \fB\-\-netboot\-enabled\fP record in the Cobbler system record. This eliminates the potential for a PXE boot loop
if the system is set to PXE first in it\(aqs BIOS order. Enable this if PXE is first in your BIOS boot order, otherwise

Cobbler\(aqs configuration. these roles are: \fBconfig_admin\fP and \fBorg_admin\fP\&. Users should turn this on only if they
want this behavior and do not have a cross\-multi\-org separation concern. If you have a single org in your satellite,
it\(aqs probably safe to turn this on and then you can use CobblerWeb alongside a Satellite install.

.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS remove_old_puppet_certs_automatically
.sp
When a puppet managed machine is reinstalled it is necessary to remove the puppet certificate from the puppet master
server before a new certificate is signed (see above). Enabling the following feature will ensure that the certificate

default: \fB"\-l \-n \-d"\fP
.SS reposync_rsync_flags
.sp
Flags to use for rysync\(aqs reposync. If archive mode (\-a,\-\-archive) is used then createrepo is not ran after the rsync as
it pulls down the repodata as well. This allows older OS\(aqs to mirror modular repos using rsync.
.sp
default: \fB"\-rltDv \-\-copy\-unsafe\-links"\fP
.SS restart_*
.sp
When DHCP and DNS management are enabled, \fBcobbler sync\fP can automatically restart those services to apply changes.
The exception for this is if using ISC for DHCP, then OMAPI eliminates the need for a restart. \fBomapi\fP, however, is
experimental and not recommended for most configurations. If DHCP and DNS are going to be managed, but hosted on a box
that is not on this server, disable restarts here and write some other script to ensure that the config files get
copied/rsynced to the destination box. This can be done by modifying the restart services trigger. Note that if
\fBmanage_dhcp\fP and \fBmanage_dns\fP are disabled, the respective parameter will have no effect. Most users should not
need to change this.

.SS run_install_triggers
.sp
Install triggers are scripts in \fB/var/lib/cobbler/triggers/install\fP that are triggered in autoinstall pre and post
sections. Any executable script in those directories is run. They can be used to send email or perform other actions.
They are currently run as root so if you do not need this functionality you can disable it, though this will also
disable \fBcobbler status\fP which uses a logging trigger to audit install progress.
.sp
default: \fBtrue\fP
.SS scm_track_*
.sp
enables a trigger which version controls all changes to \fB/var/lib/cobbler\fP when add, edit, or sync events are
performed. This can be used to revert to previous database versions, generate RSS feeds, or for other auditing or backup
purposes. Git and Mercurial are currently supported, but Git is the recommend SCM for use with this feature.

.SS serializer_pretty_json

Sort and indent JSON output to make it more human\-readable.
.sp
default: \fBFalse\fP
.SS server
.sp
This is the address of the Cobbler server \-\- as it is used by systems during the install process, it must be the address
or hostname of the system as those systems can see the server. if you have a server that appears differently to
different subnets (dual homed, etc), you need to read the \fB\-\-server\-override\fP section of the manpage for how that
works.
.sp
default: \fB127.0.0.1\fP
.SS sign_puppet_certs_automatically
.sp
When puppet starts on a system after installation it needs to have its certificate signed by the puppet master server.
Enabling the following feature will ensure that the puppet server signs the certificate after installation if the puppet
master server is running on the same machine as Cobbler. This requires \fBpuppet_auto_setup\fP above to be enabled.
.sp
default: \fBfalse\fP
.SS signature_path
.sp
The \fBcobbler import\fP workflow is powered by this file. Its location can be set with this config option.
.sp
default: \fB/var/lib/cobbler/distro_signatures.json\fP
.SS signature_url
.sp
Updates to the signatures may happen more often then we have releases. To enable you to import new version we provide
the most up to date signatures we offer on this like. You may host this file for yourself and adjust it for your needs.
.sp
default: \fBhttps://cobbler.github.io/signatures/3.0.x/latest.json\fP
.SS tftpboot_location
.sp
This variable contains the location of the tftpboot directory. If this directory is not present Cobbler does not start.
.sp
Default: \fB/srv/tftpboot\fP
.SS virt_auto_boot
.sp
Should new profiles for virtual machines default to auto booting with the physical host when the physical host reboots?
This can be overridden on each profile or system object.
.sp

Cobbler\(aqs web directory.  Don\(aqt change this setting \-\- see the Wiki on "relocating your Cobbler install" if your /var partition
is not large enough.

.SS xmlrpc_port
.sp
Cobbler\(aqs public XML\-RPC listens on this port. Change this only if absolutely needed, as you\(aqll have to start supplying
a new port option to Koan if it is not the default.
.sp
default: \fB25151\fP
.SS yum_distro_priority
.sp
The default yum priority for all the distros. This is only used if yum\-priorities plugin is used. 1 is the maximum
value. Tweak with caution.
.sp
default: \fBtrue\fP
.SS yum_post_install_mirror
.sp
\fBcobbler repo add\fP commands set Cobbler up with repository information that can be used during autoinstall and is
automatically set up in the Cobbler autoinstall templates. By default, these are only available at install time. To
make these repositories usable on installed systems (since Cobbler makes a very convenient mirror) set this to \fBTrue\fP\&.
Most users can safely set this to \fBTrue\fP\&. Users who have a dual homed Cobbler server, or are installing laptops that
will not always have access to the Cobbler server may wish to leave this as \fBFalse\fP\&. In that case, the Cobbler
mirrored yum repos are still accessible at \fBhttp://cobbler.example.org/cblr/repo_mirror\fP and YUM configuration can
still be done manually. This is just a shortcut.
.sp
default: \fBTrue\fP
.SS yumdownloader_flags
.sp
Flags to use for yumdownloader. Not all versions may support \fB\-\-resolve\fP\&.
.sp
