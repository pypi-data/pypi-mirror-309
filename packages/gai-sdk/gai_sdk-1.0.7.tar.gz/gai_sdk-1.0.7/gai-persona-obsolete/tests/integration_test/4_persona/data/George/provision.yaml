      ToolDesc:
          The 'google' function is a powerful tool that allows the AI to gather
          external information from the internet using Google search. It can be invoked
          when the AI needs to answer a question or provide information that requires up-to-date,
          comprehensive, and diverse sources which are not inherently known by the AI. For
          instance, it can be used to find current news, weather updates, latest sports
          scores, trending topics, specific facts, or even the current date and time. The
          usage of this tool should be considered when the user's query implies or explicitly
          requests recent or wide-ranging data, or when the AI's inherent knowledge base
          may not have the required or most current information. The 'search_query' parameter
          should be a concise and accurate representation of the information needed.
      ToolName: google
      ToolParameters:
          - Id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
            ParamDescription:
                The search query to search google with. For example, to find
                the current date or time, use 'current date' or 'current time' respectively.
