class RandomComponent:
    """Base class for all random components in the environment.

    Every component (e.g. ReferenceGenerator or ElectricMotor) that has any kind of random behavior has to derive from
    the RandomComponent class directly or indirectly via its own base class.

    During the seeding of the environment, the random components 'seed' function is called and a sub-seed is passed
    for every random component. From this sub-seed, further new seeds and reference generators
    are generated at the beginning of each episode. This ensures a reproducible random behavior for each new episode
    no matter how long the previous episodes have been. Therefore, each random environment component has to call the
    'next_generator()' method during reset.

    Everytime a random number is used, it has to be drawn from the ``random_generator``.

    Example:

        >>> import gym_electric_motor as gem
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>>
        >>>
        >>> class MyRandomReferenceGenerator(gem.ReferenceGenerator, gem.RandomComponent):

        >>>         gem.ReferenceGenerator.__init__(self)
        >>>         gem.RandomComponent.__init__(self)
        >>>         self.my_random_var = np.array([0.0]) # Only for exemplary purpose
        >>>         # Further custom initialization
        >>>         # ...
        >>>
        >>>     def reset(self, initial_state=None, initial_reference=None):
        >>>         self.next_generator()
        >>>         # Reset further components states
        >>>
        >>>     def get_reference(self, state, *_, **__):
        >>>         # Draw from the classes random_generator
        >>>         self.my_random_var = self.random_generator.normal(size=1)
        >>>         # Do something with the random variable e.g.:
        >>>         return np.ones_like(state) * self.my_random_var
        >>>
        >>>     def get_reference_observation(self, state, *_, **__):
        >>>         # Do sth.
