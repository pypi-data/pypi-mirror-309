# DBalance - Docker Balance designed for use with Docker Swarm

DBalance will connect to the Docker Swarm using HTTPS and retrieve details of the Services and Tasks 
running on each Node

Optionally a rebalance can be performed

By default no rebalance is performed instead a list of the Services and locations where they are running
along with information about how they can be placed if a rebalance were performed.

Rebalancing can be achieved by specifying the -b option
