Therefore, the method also takes a `deformation_axis` parameter that indicates which axis should be Hadamared. The method then returns a dictionary with the Pauli mapping on the current qubit. In our case, we check that the qubit location given as parameter lives on the deformation axis, and if so, we return the Hadamard mapping `{'X': 'Z', 'Y': 'Y', 'Z': 'X'}`.

    "Let's dissect the structure of this file. Since a single JSON file can describe several codes, the highest-level key simply indicates the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second level should contain two keys, `\"qubits\"` and `\"stabilizers\"`, which will respectively describe the qubits and stabilizer representations. Then, for each of those, we have to indicate two representations: one for the Kitaev picture (where qubits are usually edges) and one of the rotated picture (where qubits are usually vertices). It's mostly useful for codes that actually have those two representations (such as the 2D and 3D toric codes), but if you only want to describe one representation, you're free to copy-paste the same content in both the `\"kitaev\"` and the `\"rotated\"` fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the core of the representation. For each qubit/stabilizer in the Kitaev/rotated picture, we have to specify four elements: `\"object\"`, `\"color\"`, `\"opacity\"`, `\"params\"`. The `\"object\"` key indicates the general type of object we want. The definition of the different objects can be found in the file [panqec/gui/js/shape.js](https://github.com/panqec/panqec/blob/main/panqec/gui/js/shapes.js) of the repository, and currently contains the following possibilities: `cylinder`, `sphere`, `rectangle`, `cube` and `octahedron`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then have to indicate the color of each object. For the qubits, we have to specify four colors, depending on whether there is an error (`\"X\"`, `\"Y\"` or `\"Z\"`) or no error (`\"I\"`) on this qubit. For the stabilizers, we indicate a color for when it is activated (i.e. when there is an excitation) or not. The full list of color names can be found by printing the `StabilizerCode` property `code.colormap`. Currently, direct RBG values are not supported, but will come in subsequent versions of PanQEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also specify the opacity of our object, in four different cases, depending on whether the stabilizer/qubit is activated or not and if we currently are at the minimum or maximum opacity (this can be changed interactively in the GUI). The opacity is a number between `0` and `1`, where `0` is completely transparent and `1` completely opaque. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we specify the parameters of the object through the key `params`. Those parameters are object-dependent and can also be extracted from [panqec/gui/js/shape.js](https://github.com/panqec/panqec/blob/main/panqec/gui/js/shapes.js). Many parameters correspond to sizes (such as the radius of a sphere or the lengths of a cube), and for those, the scale is defined following the convention of the coordinate system defined above."

Indeed, in some coordinate system, the coordinates of a qubit or stabilizer can be different from its spatial location. For instance, we previously discussed how if two qubit or two stabilizers are sitting at the same location, we can add a new coordinate to specify it uniquely. An example where this appears is the Haah code, where each site contains two qubits. Qubit coordinates are therefore specified as a 4-tuple `(i,x,y,z)`. where `i` is either `0` or `1`.
