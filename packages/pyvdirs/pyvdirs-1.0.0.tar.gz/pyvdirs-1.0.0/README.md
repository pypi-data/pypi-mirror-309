# PyVDirs

A simple package to manage directories locally, never explicitely defining them inside the code.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This package can easily be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyvdirs
```

It is good practice to always create a Python virtual environment before installing new packages.
