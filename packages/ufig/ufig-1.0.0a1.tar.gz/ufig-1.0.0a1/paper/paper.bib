@article{herbel, title={The redshift distribution of cosmological samples: a forward modeling approach}, volume={2017}, ISSN={1475-7516}, DOI={10.1088/1475-7516/2017/08/035}, abstractNote={Determining the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxy samples is essential for several cosmological probes including weak lensing. For imaging surveys, this is usually done using photometric redshifts estimated on an object-by-object basis. We present a new approach for directly measuring the global $n(z)$ of cosmological galaxy samples, including uncertainties, using forward modeling. Our method relies on image simulations produced using UFig (Ultra Fast Image Generator) and on ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) within the $MCCL$ (Monte-Carlo Control Loops) framework. The galaxy population is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy distributions, sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We apply exactly the same analysis to the real data and to the simulated images, which also include instrumental and observational effects. By adjusting the parameters of the simulations, we derive a set of acceptable models that are statistically consistent with the data. We then apply the same cuts to the simulations that were used to construct the target galaxy sample in the real data. The redshifts of the galaxies in the resulting simulated samples yield a set of $n(z)$ distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the method by determining $n(z)$ for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the 4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data in the COSMOS field. We also complement this imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample from the VVDS survey. We compare our resulting posterior $n(z)$ distributions to the one derived from photometric redshifts estimated using 36 photometric bands in COSMOS and find good agreement. This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current and future large imaging surveys.}, note={arXiv: 1705.05386}, number={08}, journal={Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics}, author={Herbel, Jörg and Kacprzak, Tomasz and Amara, Adam and Refregier, Alexandre and Bruderer, Claudio and Nicola, Andrina}, year={2017}, month=aug, pages={035–035} }

@article{herbel_psf, title={Fast Point Spread Function Modeling with Deep Learning}, volume={2018}, ISSN={1475-7516}, DOI={10.1088/1475-7516/2018/07/054}, abstractNote={Modeling the Point Spread Function (PSF) of wide-field surveys is vital for many astrophysical applications and cosmological probes including weak gravitational lensing. The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and therefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies from astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the dominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid biases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to calibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$) framework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a large amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast yet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence, such forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is quick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey data. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast deep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our approach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important features of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we construct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring that it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This allows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS stars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is able to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the speed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good prospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework.}, note={arXiv:1801.07615 [astro-ph, stat]}, number={07}, journal={Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics}, author={Herbel, Jörg and Kacprzak, Tomasz and Amara, Adam and Refregier, Alexandre and Lucchi, Aurelien}, year={2018}, month=jul, pages={054–054} }

In this work, we propose a novel technique to forward model wide-field broad-band galaxy surveys using the fast image simulator UFig and measure the LF of galaxies in the B-band. We use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to constrain the galaxy population model parameters of the simulations and match data from CFHTLS. We define a number of distance metrics between the simulated and the survey data. By exploring the parameter space of the galaxy population model through ABC to find the set of parameters that minimize these distance metrics, we obtain constraints on the LFs of blue and red galaxies as a function of redshift. We find that $mathrm{M^*}$ fades by $Delta mathrm{M}^*_{mathrm{0.1-1.0,b}} = 0.68 pm 0.52$ and $Delta mathrm{M}^*_{mathrm{0.1-1.0,r}} = 0.54 pm 0.48$ magnitudes between redshift $mathrm{z = 1}$ and $mathrm{z = 0.1}$ for blue and red galaxies, respectively. We also find that $phi^*$ for blue galaxies stays roughly constant between redshift $mathrm{z = 0.1}$ and $mathrm{z=1}$, while for red galaxies it decreases by $sim 35%$. We compare our results to other measurements, finding good agreement at all redshifts, for both blue and red galaxies. To further test our results, we compare the redshift distributions for survey and simulated data. We use the spectroscopic redshift distribution from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) and we apply the same selection in colours and magnitudes on our simulations. We find a good agreement between the survey and the simulated redshift distributions. We provide best-fit values and uncertainties for the parameters of the LF. This work offers excellent prospects for measuring other galaxy population properties as a function of redshift using ABC.}, author={Tortorelli, Luca and Fagioli, Martina and Herbel, Jörg and Amara, Adam and Kacprzak, Tomasz and Refregier, Alexandre}, year={2020}, month=jan, language={en} }

In this work, we forward-model the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) narrow-band data. The aim is to improve the constraints on the spectral coefficients used to create the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) of the galaxy population model in Tortorelli et al. 2020. In that work, the model parameters were inferred from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) data using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). This led to stringent constraints on the B-band galaxy luminosity function parameters, but left the spectral coefficients only broadly constrained. To address that, we perform an ABC inference using CFHTLS and PAUS data. This is the first time our approach combining forward-modelling and ABC is applied simultaneously to multiple datasets. We test the results of the ABC inference by comparing the narrow-band magnitudes of the observed and simulated galaxies using Principal Component Analysis, finding a very good agreement. Furthermore, we prove the scientific potential of the constrained galaxy population model to provide realistic stellar population properties by measuring them with the SED fitting code textsc{CIGALE}. We use CFHTLS broad-band and PAUS narrow-band photometry for a flux-limited ($mathrm{i}<22.5$) sample of galaxies up to redshift $mathrm{z sim 0.8}$. We find that properties like stellar masses, star-formation rates, mass-weighted stellar ages and metallicities are in agreement within errors between observations and simulations.

This cosmic shear technique relies on the accurate measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background galaxies and requires precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) is a forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match the target data statistically, followed by calibrations and tolerance loops. We present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the shear power spectrum $C_{ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the background galaxy sample. The method includes maps of the systematic sources, Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and the fast estimation of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical agreement between the simulations and the DES Y1 data using an array of diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_ell$ and $n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the systematic uncertainty. Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination of $Omega_m$, $sigma_8$, and intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{rm{IA}}$, defined as $S_8D_{rm{IA}} = sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{rm{IA}}$, where $D_{rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{rm{IA}}-1)$. We find $S_8D_{rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$, where systematics are at the level of roughly 60% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results in the context of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that this method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear measurements with future wide-field surveys.}, note={arXiv: 1906.01018}, number={8}, journal={Physical Review D}, author={Kacprzak, T. and Herbel, J. and Nicola, A. and Sgier, R. and Tarsitano, F. and Bruderer, C. and Amara, A. and Refregier, A. and Bridle, S.

In a forward modelling approach, the redshift distribution n(z) of a galaxy sample is measured using a parametric galaxy population model constrained by observations. We use a model that captures the redshift evolution of the galaxy luminosity functions, colours, and morphology, for red and blue samples. We constrain this model via simulation-based inference, using factorized Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) at the image level. We apply this framework to HSC deep field images, complemented with photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020. The simulated telescope images include realistic observational and instrumental effects. By applying the same processing and selection to real data and simulations, we obtain a sample of n(z) distributions from the ABC posterior. The photometric properties of the simulated galaxies are in good agreement with those from the real data, including magnitude, colour and redshift joint distributions. We compare the posterior n(z) from our simulations to the COSMOS2020 redshift distributions obtained via template fitting photometric data spanning the wavelength range from UV to IR. We mitigate sample variance in COSMOS by applying a reweighting technique. We thus obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed redshift distributions, with a difference in the mean at the 1$sigma$ level up to a magnitude of 24 in the i band. We discuss how our forward model can be applied to current and future surveys and be further extended.

GREAT10 was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the shear field and the Point Spread Function (PSF) vary across the images in a realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are inaccessible to constant shear simulations including a direct measure of the impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape measurement bias for cosmic shear we present a general pseudo-Cl formalism, that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy achieved by shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-percent average biases. We find a strong dependence in accuracy as a function of signal-to-noise, and indications of a weak dependence on galaxy type and size. Some requirements for the most ambitious cosmic shear experiments are met above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. These results have the caveat that the simulated PSF was a ground-based PSF. Our results are a snapshot of the accuracy of current shape measurement methods and are a benchmark upon which improvement can continue. This provides a foundation for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of shape measurement methods.}, note={arXiv:1202.5254 [astro-ph]}, number={4}, journal={Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}, author={Kitching, T.

Systematic errors in shear estimation and the impact of real galaxy morphology}, volume={450}, ISSN={0035-8711, 1365-2966}, DOI={10.1093/mnras/stv781}, abstractNote={We present ﬁrst results from the third GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for testing methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three speciﬁc questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear ﬁelds. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by ∼1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to ﬁnite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the Se´rsic index, are quantiﬁed for the ﬁrst time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and defocus. Almost all methods’ results support the simple model in which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.}, number={3}, journal={Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}, author={Mandelbaum, Rachel and Rowe, Barnaby and Armstrong, Robert and Bard, Deborah and Bertin, Emmanuel and Bosch, James and Boutigny, Dominique and Courbin, Frederic and Dawson, William A. and Donnarumma, Annamaria and Fenech Conti, Ian and Gavazzi, Raphaël and Gentile, Marc and Gill, Mandeep S.

 @article{bruderer, title={Calibrated Ultra Fast Image Simulations for the Dark Energy Survey}, volume={817}, ISSN={0004-637X, 1538-4357}, DOI={10.3847/0004-637X/817/1/25}, abstractNote={Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful technique to probe the dark components of the universe. To understand the measurement process of weak lensing and the associated systematic effects, image simulations are becoming increasingly important. For this purpose we present a first implementation of the $textit{Monte Carlo Control Loops}$ ($textit{MCCL}$; Refregier & Amara 2014), a coherent framework for studying systematic effects in weak lensing. It allows us to model and calibrate the shear measurement process using image simulations from the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig; Berge et al. 2013). We apply this framework to a subset of the data taken during the Science Verification period (SV) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We calibrate the UFig simulations to be statistically consistent with DES images. We then perform tolerance analyses by perturbing the simulation parameters and study their impact on the shear measurement at the one-point level. This allows us to determine the relative importance of different input parameters to the simulations. For spatially constant systematic errors and six simulation parameters, the calibration of the simulation reaches the weak lensing precision needed for the DES SV survey area. Furthermore, we find a sensitivity of the shear measurement to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, and an interplay between the magnitude-size and the pixel value diagnostics in constraining the noise model. This work is the first application of the $textit{MCCL}$ framework to data and shows how it can be used to methodically study the impact of systematics on the cosmic shear measurement.}, note={arXiv:1504.02778 [astro-ph]}, number={1}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Bruderer, Claudio and Chang, Chihway and Refregier, Alexandre and Amara, Adam and Berge, Joel and Gamper, Lukas}, year={2016}, month=jan, pages={25} }
