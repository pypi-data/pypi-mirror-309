## Why

I have serveral machines local and remote that I have InvokeAI installed on. I wanted a simple way to update/downgrade them without having to manually
download the release from github and install it on each machine. This tool allows me to do that. It also made sense to use the offical InvokeAI installer
instead roll a patch work that may not work as expected.

You have a couple of options for installing/running the tool:

### Install [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/), then run the tool with the following command

```bash
pipx install nero-cli
```

### Alternatively, you can install using `pip`

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage // Available Commands

Once installed via pipx or pip:

```
usage: nero [-h] [--dry-run] [--download-only] [--latest] [--version VERSION] [--rollback] [--keep] [--download-dir DOWNLOAD_DIR] [--check] [--update-config]
