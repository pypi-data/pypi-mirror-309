    Run MD for a specific time

    Green-Kubo runs, we treat calculators as follows:

    Ideally, a Calculator should implement a `.virials` property that
    enables/disables the computation of virials. If `calc.virials=True`,
    they should be computed when `.calculate()` is  called. The `virials`
    should be written into `results`. They will be logged. If `virials=True`,
    the `stress` property should also be computed for legacy reasons.

    Calculators that do not implement this are expected to write `stresses`
    into their `results` when `calculate()` is called. Turning `stresses`
    computation on and off every n-th step is not supported for those, so
    make sure that for a GK run, the calculator is set up to compute them.

    FHI-aims with socketio is a special case. Here turning on and off is
    supported through custom means.
