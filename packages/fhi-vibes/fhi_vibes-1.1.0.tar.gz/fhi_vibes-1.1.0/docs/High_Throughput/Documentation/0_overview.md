This section defines the high-throughput definitions for all the keywords for the following tasks:

- [Installing FireWorks Dependency](../Installation/0_setup.md)
- [Setting up a high-throughput workflow](1_general_high_throughput.md)
- [qadapters](2_qadapter.md)
- [K-Point Density Convergence](3_optimize_k_grid.md)
- [Relaxation](4_relaxation.md)
- [Phonon Calculations](5_phonons.md)
- [Monte Carlo Sampling](6_statistical_sampling.md)
- [Molecular Dynamics](7_md.md)
- [Conditional Workflows](8_stop_if.md)

At the moment only FHI-aims is supported for high-throughput calculations. It is possible to extend it to other calculators, but certain transitions between steps assume the calculator is for FHI-aims and those would have to change.
