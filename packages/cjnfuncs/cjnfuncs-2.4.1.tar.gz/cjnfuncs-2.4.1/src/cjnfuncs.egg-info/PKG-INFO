# cjnfuncs - A framework and collection of utility functions for script writing

## cjnfuncs is comprised of several modules (follow links to respective documentation)

NOTE:  Since relative links to other .md files do not work on PyPI, please go to the [cjnfuncs GitHub repo](https://github.com/cjnaz/cjnfuncs) to read the documentation. 

module | Description/Purpose
--|--
[core](core.md)               | Set up the base environment
[configman](configman.md)     | Feature-rich configuration file toolset
[timevalue](timevalue.md)     | Handle time values with units, such as '5m' (5 minutes)
[mungePath](mungePath.md)     | Ease-of-use pathlib extension for constructing and manipulating file paths
[deployfiles](deployfiles.md) | Push bundled setup files within a package to the proper user/system locations
[resourcelock](resourcelock.md) | Inter-process resource lock mechanism
[SMTP](SMTP.md)               | Send notification and email messages

Developed and tested on Python 3.6.8, and supported on all higher Python versions.
Developed on Linux.  Not supported on Windows (posix-ipc module dependency).

In this documentation, "tool script" refers to a Python project that imports and uses cjnfuncs. Some may be simple scripts, and others may themselves be installed packages.

## Installation and usage

```
pip install cjnfuncs
```

A package template using cjnfuncs is available at https://github.com/cjnaz/tool_template, which 
is the basis of PyPI posted tools such as:
  - [lanmonitor](https://pypi.org/project/lanmonitor/)
  - [wanstatus](https://pypi.org/project/wanstatus/)
  - [routermonitor](https://pypi.org/project/routermonitor/)
