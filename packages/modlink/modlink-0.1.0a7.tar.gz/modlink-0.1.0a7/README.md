# ModLink

ModLink is a library designed to give agents a means to communicate.

See the [PATTERN.md](PATTERN.md) for more information on the pattern used in ModLink.

## Usage

For more detailed usage and examples, see the [examples](examples/README.md) directory. After defining your agents, you can link them with additional tools. For instance, you can use [AgentArgParser](modlink/tools/agent_arg_parser.py) to enable command-line interaction with your agents.
