It includes base classes for genetic algorithms, such as DNA representation, population management, fitness evaluation, and various selection, crossover, and mutation strategies. This library is designed for users to easily implement and test their own genetic algorithms for optimization problems.

## Features
- Customizable selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness strategies.
- Predefined strategies in the `defaults` module for common use cases.
- Modular design to facilitate integration with different types of genetic algorithms.

dna_strategy = DNAStrategy(
    genes=genes,
    target=target,
    selection_strategy=RouletteWheelSelection(),

# Use the custom strategy
dna_strategy = DNAStrategy(
  genes=[0, 1],
  selection_strategy=CustomSelection()
)
```
