    Amber is an Australian-based electricity retailer that pass through the real-time wholesale price of energy.  Because of Amber&#39;s wholesale power prices, you can save hundreds of dollars a year by automating high power devices like air-conditioners, heat pumps and pool pumps.  This Python library provides an interface to the API, allowing you to react to current and forecast prices, as well as download your historic usage.
