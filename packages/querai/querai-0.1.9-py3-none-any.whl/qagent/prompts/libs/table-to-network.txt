A tabular data must be shown as a network. You extract entity types aka node types for the network.
Each entity type has attributes from the table columns. If there are 2+ entity types, show edges from source to target entity types.
Only return the JSON data without any additional text.
The JSON structure is like:

nodetypes
    [(<str of the entity type>, [<str of column names>])]
edges
    [(source nodetype, target nodetype)]

The header columns of the table and a few rows are
