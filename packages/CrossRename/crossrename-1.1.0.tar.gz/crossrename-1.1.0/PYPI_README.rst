Introduction
============

CrossRename is a command-line tool designed to harmonize file names
across Linux and Windows systems. It ensures that your file names are
compatible with both operating systems, eliminating naming conflicts
when transferring files between different environments.

Features
========

-  Sanitizes file names to be Windows-compatible (and thus
   Linux-compatible)
-  Handles both individual files and entire directories
-  Supports recursive renaming of files in subdirectories
-  Preserves file extensions, including compound extensions like .tar.gz
-  Provides informative logging
-  Provides a dry-run mode to preview renaming changes without executing them
-  Skips recursive symlinks to avoid infinite loops

Installation
============

From PyPI (Using PIP)
---------------------

::

   pip install CrossRename

Usage
=====

::

   usage: crossrename [-h] [-p PATH] [-v] [-u] [-r] [-d]

   CrossRename: Harmonize file names for Linux and Windows.

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -p PATH, --path PATH  The path to the file or directory to rename.
     -v, --version         Prints out the current version and quits.
     -u, --update          Check if a new version is available.
     -r, --recursive       Rename all files in the directory path given and its subdirectories.
     -d, --dry-run         Perform a dry run, logging changes without renaming.

Examples
--------

Rename a single file:

::

   crossrename -p /path/to/file.txt

Rename all files in a directory (and its subdirectories):

::

   crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r

Perform a dry run to preview renaming changes without executing them:

::

   crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r -d


Check for an update:

::

   crossrename -u


Why did I build this?
=====================

.. warning::

   I'm no longer dual booting. I'm only using Windows 10 now. I do have
   WSL2 and that's what I use for testing. I don't know if there'll be
   any difference in the way the tool works on a native Linux system.

I'm a dual-booter running Windows 10 and Lubuntu 22.04. One day
(literally yesterday lol), while transferring a folder between the two
systems, I hit a naming roadblock. Five stubborn files refused to budge,
thanks to the quirky differences in file naming rules between Linux and
Windows.

This experience got me thinking. You see, I had previously built
`FicImage <https://github.com/Jemeni11/ficimage>`__, a nifty application
that elevates the reading experience of `FicHub <https://fichub.net/>`__
epubs by adding missing images. It required handling file creation and
renaming, and that knowledge proved invaluable.

And so, CrossRename was born â€“ a tool to simplify your life when
managing files between Linux and Windows. No more naming hassles, just
smooth, worry-free file management.
