## Requirements ##
This package requires Python 3.6 or later. Install dependencies via pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Dependencies:
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
SciPy: For Simpson's rule integration.
PyVista: For reading and handling .vtk files.
OS: For handling and import of files 


## Key Functions ##
compute_packing_density(file, boundaries=None, report_progress=False)
Description: Computes the packing density of particles in a cuboidal region.

Args:
file (str): Path to the .vtk file containing particle data.
boundaries (dict, optional): Defines cuboidal region (x_min, x_max, etc.). Defaults to dataset bounds.
report_progress (bool, optional): If True, prints progress during computation.

Returns: Float representing the packing density.


single_cap_intersection(R, a)
Description: Calculates the volume of a single spherical cap.


double_cap_intersection(R, a, b)
Description: Calculates the volume of a double spherical cap intersection.


triple_cap_intersection(R, a, b, c)
Description: Calculates the volume of a triple spherical cap intersection.


## How It Works ##
Read Data:
Uses PyVista to read .vtk files containing particle coordinates and radii.

Define Boundaries:
Boundaries are calculated from the dataset by default or can be user-specified.

Volume Calculation:
Single, double, and triple cap intersections are evaluated using numerical methods for accurate volume determination.

Packing Density:
The total particle volume inside the defined boundaries is divided by the cuboidal cell volume to compute packing density.

## Testing ##
Tests will be added in a future release.

## Limitations ##
Currently optimized for spherical particles only.
Requires .vtk files with properly formatted particle data.
Numerical integration precision depends on num_simpson_sample_points (adjustable).

## Planned Features ##
Add support for non-spherical particle shapes.
Include formal tests in the next version.
Performance optimization for very large datasets.
