# SnapSort  

### Note: SnapSort is currently in development and may not be fully functional.

**SnapSort** is a light weighted (relatively) command-line tool that helps you classify and organize your photos based on focus accuracy, exposure (overexposed/underexposed), and content (landscape/portrait). SnapSort leverages OpenCV for image processing and allows you to quickly sort your photos into categorized folders for easy management.

## Features
- **Semantic search**: Search for images based on your prompt.
- **Exposure Classification**: Identify overexposed and underexposed images.
- **Find similar images**: Find similar images based on a reference image.

## Installation

You can install SnapSort using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cli-snapsort
```

## Development
```bash
git clone ...
pip install --editable .
```
