This package will contain the common functions, classes and other definitions for the `gui-executor` and the `tui-executor` packages. These will be the definitions that need to be used when defining tasks. The idea is that any task (or recurring task) can be used and executed by either package, `gui-executor` for the Qt vesion, and `tui-executor` for the Textual version.
