## Version Compatibility

### Type-checkers

For validation and testing, `scipy-stubs` primarily uses [`basedmypy`](https://github.com/KotlinIsland/basedmypy) (a `mypy` fork)
and [`basedpyright`](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright) (a `pyright` fork).
They are in generally stricter than `mypy` and `pyright`, so you can assume compatibility with `mypy` and `pyright` as well.
But if you find that this isn't the case, then don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Required dependencies

The versioning scheme of `scipy-stubs` includes the compatible `scipy` version as `{scipy_version}.{stubs_version}`.
Even though `scipy-stubs` doesn't enforce an upper bound on the `scipy` version, later `scipy` versions aren't guaranteed to be
fully compatible.

Apart from `scipy`'s own dependencies, (e.g. `numpy`), the only other required dependency is
[`optype`](https://github.com/jorenham/optype), which itself only depends on `typing_extensions`.

The exact version requirements are specified in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).
