## What is URL Expander?

[URL Expander](https://www.linksgpt.com/url-expander) is a tool that reveals the final destination of any URL, including shortened links. It allows users to see the original or expanded URL that is hidden behind a short link. By entering a shortened URL, the tool retrieves the actual URL destination and provides users with more information about where they will be directed if they click on the link. This is especially important for security purposes, as shortened URLs can be a means to disguise malicious or harmful links. By expanding the link, users can assess its legitimacy and make more informed decisions about whether to click on it.
