# ContextCheck

A human-friendly framework for testing and evaluating LLMs, RAGs, and chatbots.

**ContextCheck** is an open-source framework designed to evaluate, test, and validate large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and chatbots. It provides tools to automatically generate queries, request completions, detect regressions, perform penetration tests, and assess hallucinations, ensuring the robustness and reliability of these systems. ContextCheck is configurable via YAML and can be integrated into continuous integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing.

## Features

- **Simple test scenario definition** using human-readable `.yaml` files
- **Flexible endpoint configuration** for OpenAI, HTTP, and more
- **Customizable JSON request/response models**
- **Support for variables and Jinja2 templating** in YAML files
- **Response validation** options, including heuristics, LLM-based judgment, and human labeling
- **Enhanced output formatting** with the `rich` package for clear, readable displays


## Installation

### For Users

Install the package directly from PyPI using pip:

```sh
pip install ccheck
```

After installation, you can access the `ccheck` CLI command:

```sh
ccheck --help
```

This will display all available options and help you get started with using ContextCheck.

### For Developers

If you wish to contribute to the project or modify it for your own use, you can set up a development environment using Poetry.

1. Fork your own copy of Addepto/contextcheck on GitHub.
2. Clone the Repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/contextcheck.git
  cd contextcheck
  ```
3. Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
4. Install Dependencies:
  ```sh
  poetry install
  ```
5. Activate the Virtual Environment:
  ```sh
  poetry shell
  ```
6. Activate the `ccheck` CLI command using:
  ```sh
  poetry run ccheck --help
  ```

## CLI Features

### Output Test Results to Console

- **Run a single scenario and output results to the console:**
  ```sh
  ccheck --output-type console --filename path/to/file.yaml
  ```
- **Run multiple scenarios and output results to the console:**
  ```sh
  ccheck --output-type console --filename path/to/file.yaml path/to/another_file.yaml
  ```

### Running in CI/CD

To automatically stop the CI/CD process if any tests fail, add the `--exit-on-failure` flag. Failed test will cause the script to exit with code 1:

```sh
ccheck --exit-on-failure --output-type console --folder my_tests
```

Use env variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be able to run:
- `tests/scenario_openai.yaml`
- `tests/scenario_defaults.yaml`


## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!

### Running Tests

To run tests:
```
poetry run pytest tests/
```

To include tests which require calling LLM APIs (currently OpenAI and Ollama), run one of:
```
poetry run pytest --openai          # includes tests that use OpenAI API
poetry run pytest --ollama          # includes tests that use Ollama API
poetry run pytest --openai --ollama # includes tests that use both OpenAI and Ollama API
```
