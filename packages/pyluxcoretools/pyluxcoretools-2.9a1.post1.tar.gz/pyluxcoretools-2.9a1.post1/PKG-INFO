A Python package to provide LuxCoreTools.

# LuxCoreRender
LuxCoreRender is a physically correct, unbiased rendering engine.
It is built on physically based equations that model the transportation of
light. This allows it to accurately capture a wide range of phenomena which
most other rendering programs are simply unable to reproduce.
