title: Strict Mode
---

A module can enable 'strict mode' by setting `strict: true` in its configuration within [`tach.toml`](configuration#tachtoml).

## How does it work?

When a module is in strict mode, other modules may only import names declared in `__all__`.
For Python packages marked as modules, `__all__` is checked within `__init__.py`.
This creates an explicit public interface for the module which prevents coupling to implementation details, and makes future changes easier.

## Example

Given modules called 'core' and 'parsing', we may have `tach.toml` contents like this:

```toml
# tach.toml
[[modules]]
path = "parsing"
depends_on = [
    { path = "core" }
]
strict = true

[[modules]]
path = "core"
depends_on = []
strict = true
```

Then, in `parsing.py`, we may have:

```python
from core.main import get_data  # This import fails

get_data()
```

This import would **fail** `tach check` with the following error:

```shell
❌ parsing.py[L1]: Module 'core' is in strict mode. Only imports from the public interface of this module are allowed. The import 'core.main.get_data' (in module 'parsing') is not included in __all__.
```

If `get_data` should actually be part of the public interface of 'core', it needs to be specified in `__all__` of `core/__init__.py` or `core.py`:

`core/__init__.py`

```python
from .main import get_data

__all__ = ["get_data"]
```

which would allow 'parsing' to depend on this interface:

```python
from core import get_data  # This import is OK

get_data()
```

`tach check` will now pass!

```bash
✅ All module dependencies validated!
```
