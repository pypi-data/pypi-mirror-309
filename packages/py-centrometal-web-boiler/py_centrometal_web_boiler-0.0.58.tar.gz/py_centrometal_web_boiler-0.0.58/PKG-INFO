# py-centrometal-web-boiler

Python library to interact with Centrometal Boiler System. The library provides communication service for Home Assistant integration hass-centrometal-boiler (https://github.com/9a4gl/hass-centrometal-boiler).

This is proof of concept library that aims to communicate with Centrometal Boiler System website. It is based on analysis of Centrometal's web application. I have asked Centrometal for specification and support for integrating their boilers into Home Assistant. They have not replied to any of my 5 emails sent during March, April and May of 2021. After calling them by phone, they comfirmed receiving of my emails and promised to contact me back on Friday 16-Apr-2021, but that have not happened on 16-Apr-2021 or any date later so far. What a pity.
