# 4. Several Other Expansion Functions

In addition to the Taylor's expansion, `tinybig` has also implemented several other data expansion functions, some of which
will be introduced in the following part of this tutorial.

### 4.1 Bspline Expansion Function

```python

```

### 4.2 RBF Expansion Function

### 4.3 Hyperbolic Expansion Function

## 5. Probabilistic Expansion Functions

### 5.1 Naive Probabilistic Expansion

### 5.2 Combinatorial Probabilistic Expansion
