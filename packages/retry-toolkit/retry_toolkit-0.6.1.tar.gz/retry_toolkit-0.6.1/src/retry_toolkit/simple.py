'''A "simple" retry implementation.

Retry has been done and redone many times. Here is a version that takes only
a few arguments that are all optional but provides most of the flexibility
seen in many implementations.

It does not try to define all the different variables that may be used to
compute backoff values, instead preferring to allow a callable that could use
any algorithm desired to compute a backoff of which 3 very simple
implementations are provided. Users can use these as an example to setup their
own perfect backoff implementation (hopefully using jitter as well).

Or perhaps you should not use this module as a dependency, but instead copy
the strategy below, include it in your own codebase, and alter it to make it
your own. MIT is a permissive license.

    '''Decorator factory, enables retries.

    This is a decorator factory with some arguments to customize the retry
    behavior. Either specify constants or callables that will return the
    appropriate constants.

    The parameters can also be set to callables returning the type indicated
    below. For backoff, the callable must be able to take a single argument
    which will be the retry number (1 for first retry, 2 for second, etc).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tries:
        Number of times to try an operation including the first attempt which
        is not technically a RE-try.

        If set to a callable, it must have signature:

            () -> int

        If not present in arguments, Defaults.TRIES is used.

    backoff:
        Value in seconds of an amount to wait before next attempt. Can also
        be set to a callable taking the number of retries that must return
        the time to wait.

        If set to a callable, it must have signature:

            (int) -> float

        If not present in arguments, Defaults.BACKOFF is used.

    exceptions:
        Defines the exceptions to to catch for retrying. Exceptions thrown that
        are not caught will bypass further retries, be raised normally, and
        not result in a GiveUp being thrown.

        if set to a callable, it must have signature:

            () -> tuple[Exception,...] | Exception

        If not present in arguments, Defaults.EXC is used.

    Returns
    -------
    : *
        This decorator factory returns a decorator used to wrap a function. The
        wrapped function will have retry behavior and when called it will return
        whatever it normally would.

    Raises
    ------
    GiveUp
        Thrown when retries are exhausted.
