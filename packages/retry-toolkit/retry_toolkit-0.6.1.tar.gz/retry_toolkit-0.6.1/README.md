(Yet Another) Retry implementation for python.

Do you have code that may be subjected to intermittent failures? Then you should
have a retry wapper for it. This module includes a simple retry decorator
(factory) you can use. Or peek inside and copy the implementation into your own
project where you can make your own tweaks.

*No dependencies outside of standard python libraries*

## Features

- wraps a function with the following behaviors..
- configurable number of retries un case of Exception
- configurable backoff before retrying
- configurable which exceptions trigger a retry
- raises specialized 'GiveUp' exception when retries exhausted
- all configuration items accept a callable for maximum flexibility
- all configuration is processed live on each execution for compatibility
  with live adjustments, experiments, feature-flag selectable changes
- includes an async variant with all the same features

## Installation

```console
pip install retry-toolkit
```

## Examples

Defaults to 3 tries, no delays between, retry all exceptions:

```python
from retry.simple import retry

@retry()
def foo():
    some_networking_stuff()
```

Customize the basic behaviors like so:

```python
from retry.simple import retry

@retry(tries=4, backoff=1, exceptions=SomeConnectionError)
def foo():
    some_other_networking_stuff()
```
The arguments can take callables for more customization.
