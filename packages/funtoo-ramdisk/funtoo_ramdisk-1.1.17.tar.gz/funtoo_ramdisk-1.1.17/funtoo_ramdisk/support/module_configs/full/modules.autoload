# modules.autoload: This file defines logical groups of modules, and which modules should be
#                   auto-loaded by the initramfs at boot-time. Note that this file has a different
#                   purpose than modules.copy. We sometimes want to be more specific here. It's
#                   also possible that we may *not* want to auto-load modules at boot, even
#                   if they are included on the initramfs (such as, maybe, bluetooth.) In this
#                   case, a section can be omitted from this file. We may also want to *only* load
#                   the modules which will actually result in hardware being detected, and leave
#                   out any dependent modules.
#
#                   Also, unlike modules.autoload, we don't *have* to use paths here, since it's
#                   possible just to load a module by name. Here are the rules:
#
#                   If a path ends in "/*", it means load all .ko modules in this path.
#                   If a path ends in "/**", it means to recursively load all .ko modules in the path.
#                   If a path ends in ".ko", it's assumed to be a glob or a literal path.
#                   If a path has no path information such as "/" in it, and doesn't end in ".ko", it's
#                   a module name.
#
#                   Our initramfs will receive a very simplified version of this list. This file
#                   format is to make things easier for us.
