              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# pyfloyd

A parsing framework and parser generator for Python.

## Getting set up.

1. Install `uv` via whatever system-specific magic you need (e.g.,
   `brew install uv` on a Mac w/ Homebrew).
2. Run `./run devenv` to create a virtualenv at `//.venv` with
   all of the tools needed to do development (and with `pyfloyd` installed
   as an editable Python project.
3. Run `source ./.venv/bin/activate` to activate the environment and pick
   up the tools.

## Running the tests

Get set up as per the above, and then run `./run tests`.

There are other commands to `run` to do other things like lint and
format the code. `./run --help` is your friend to find out more.

## Publishing a version

1. Run `./run build`
2. Run `./run publish --test]` or `./run publish --prod` to upload to PyPI.
   If you pass `--test`, the package will be uploaded to TestPyPI instead
   of the production instance.

## Version History / Release Notes

* v0.19.0 (2024-11-18)
    * Clean up handling of external values in grammars and add more
      error checking.
    * Clean up the way the language to use when generating code is
      selected.
* v0.18.3 (2024-11-17)
    * Remove dependencies on `build`, `twine`, just use `uv build` and
      `uv publish`.
* v0.18.2 (2024-11-17)
    * Fix .gitignore.
* v0.18.1 (2024-11-18)
    * Update README.md.
* v0.18.0 (2024-11-17)
    * First release from `pyfloyd`. Renames everything and moves the
      package directory under src/.
* v0.17.4 (2024-11-17)
    * More cleanup - hopefully final release from `floyd-python`
* v0.17.3 (2024-11-17)
    * More cleanup
* v0.17.2 (2024-11-17)
    * More cleanup
* v0.17.0 (2024-11-17)
    * Remove code from `floyd-python` repo.
* v0.16.0 (2024-11-17)
    * Tons of cleanup, move to new syntax. I'm too lazy to document all of
      the changes from v0.15.0 to here. This is intended to be the last
      release of this project under this name; work will continue under
      the name `pyfloyd`.
* v0.15.0 (2024-07-05)
    * Add a JavaScript back end. As a part of this I've changed the GitHub
      CI config to install a specific version of Node so that the new
      JS codepaths are tested properly.
* v0.14.0 (2024-06-30)
    * Move a lot of the logic from python_compiler.py to a new pass in
      analyzer.py. Now python_compiler is very simple and you can start
      to see how it can be converted to something in a DSL like
      StringTemplate. This also will make it much easier to share logic
      between different compilers.
* v0.13 (2024-06-29)
    * Rework the way subrules are generated and named to be much less
      cryptic. Now rules result in methods named `_r_{rule}_` and
      subrules methods named `_s_{rule}_{i}` where i is a series of
      consecutive integers named in a depth first manner.
* v0.12 (2024-06-29)
    * Significantly rework the generated parser so that it is less like
      a set of parser combinators (self._star() and so on) and more like
      code that you'd write inline by hand. This appears to produce a
      parser close to 2x faster for 1.33x more code.
* v0.11 (2024-06-22)
    * Rework the API significantly. Now the generated parser API is a single
      `parse()` function and a data type for the return value (`Result`),
      and the public API functions are called `compile()` instead of
      `compile_parser()` and `generate()` instead of `generate_parser()`.
    * Add typing hints to everything.
    * Add lots more documentation of the API.
* v0.10.2 (2024-06-22)
    * Update test to use 79 cols instead of 80.
* v0.10.1 (2024-06-22)
    * Change formatter to default to 79 cols and regen/reformat.
* v0.10.0 (2024-06-22)
    * Clean up compiler code, rework how inlining methods works. At this
      point the compiler code is probably about as reasonably clean and
      fast as the inlining approach can be.
* v0.9.0 (2024-05-19)
    * get operator expressions working: you can now declare the precedence
      and associativity of different operators in an expression and they
      will be handled correctly. Note that there is a fair amount of
      special-casing logic for this so that only some of the expressions
      you might think would work will actually work. It's also unclear
      how well this will play with memoization.
* v0.8.0 (2024-05-19)
    * get left association in expressions that are both left- and
      right-recursive working properly.
* v0.7.0 (2024-05-05)
   * Add support for `?{...}` for semantic predicates and `{...}` for
     semantic actions in addition to `?( ... )` and `-> ...`. For now,
     both syntaxes will be supported.
* v0.6.0
   * This version number was skipped.
* v0.5.0 (2024-05-04)
   * Get automatic whitespace and comment insertion working. The
     two collectively are known as "filler".
   * You can now declare "tokens" that can consist of compound expressions
     that will not have filler interleaved.
   * Add support for positional labels in addition to named labels, i.e.
     you can write an expression as `num '+' num -> $1 + $3` in addition
     to `num:l '+' num:r -> l + r`. Both syntaxes will be supported for
     now.
   * Do much more semantic analysis to catch a broader set of errors.
   * Add support for unicode character classes via `\p{X}`.
   * Turn `--memoize` and `--main` off by default in floyd.tool.
   * Got left recursion working.
   * Added type hints to the API.
* v0.4.0
    * This version number was skipped.
* v0.3.0 (2024-04-02)
    * Changed the interpreter so that it no longer relies on runtime
      compilation.
* v0.2.0 (2024-03-31)
    * 100% test coverage.
    * Code is clean and ready for new work.
    * Add docs/goals.md to describe what I'm hoping to accomplish with
      this project.
    * Add docs/todos.md to capture everything I'm planning to fix or
      change.
* v0.1.0 (2024-03-25)
    * Copy over working code from glop v0.7.0. This copies only the code
      needed to run things, and a couple of grammars that can be used
      for hand-testing things. This does not add any tests, since I'm
      likely going to rework all of that. The code is as-is as close to
      the working glop code as I can keep it, except for updated formatting
      and copyright info. `check` and `lint` are unhappy, the `coverage`
      numbers are terrible, and we probably need to regenerate the floyd
      parser as well.
* v0.0.5 (2024-03-24)
    * There's a pattern forming.
* v0.0.4 (2024-03-24)
    * Actually bump the version this time.
* v0.0.3 (2024-03-24)
    * Fix typos and bugs found after v0.0.2 was tagged :).
* v0.0.2 (2024-03-24)
    * Fix typos found after v0.0.1 was tagged :).
* v0.0.1 (2024-03-24)
    * Initial skeleton of the project uploaded to GitHub. There is nothing
      project-specific about this project except for the name and
      description.
