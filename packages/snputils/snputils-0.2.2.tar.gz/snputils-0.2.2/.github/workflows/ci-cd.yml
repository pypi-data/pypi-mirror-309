# This workflow handles testing, documentation, and publishing for the project.
# It runs on pull requests to main and when releases are published.
# The workflow ensures that:
# 1. Tests pass before any other operations
# 2. Documentation is built and deployed (deployment only on release)
# 3. Package is published to PyPI (only on release and after docs are deployed)
