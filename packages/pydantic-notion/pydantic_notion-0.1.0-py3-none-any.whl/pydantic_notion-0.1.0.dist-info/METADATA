# pydantic-notion

**Version:** Synchronized with [Notion API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/) as of **November 18, 2024**.

---

## Overview

**pydantic-notion** is a Python library designed to bring the power of **Pydantic** to the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/). It provides type-safe, schema-validated models for every Notion API data structure, making it easier to work with API data in a structured, reliable, and maintainable way.

This library simplifies interaction with the Notion API by:
- Providing **strict Pydantic models** for all API data structures.
- Ensuring compliance with the **latest API specifications**.
- Supporting **AI Agent integration**, enabling smarter and more reliable workflows.
- Making it easier for developers to interact with Notion programmatically with minimal boilerplate.

---

## Why Use pydantic-notion?

### For Developers
- **Type safety and validation:** No more guessing data structures or debugging mysterious errors. All API data is validated against strict Pydantic models.
- **Rapid development:** Integrate Notion APIs seamlessly without having to write boilerplate validation code.
- **Error handling:** Catch issues upfront with schema validation instead of during runtime.

### For AI Agents
- **Reliable data exchange:** Ensure the AI Agent's understanding of Notion data is consistent and predictable.
- **Plug-and-play integration:** Use pydantic-notion to make Notion API interactions a first-class citizen in AI workflows.

### For Everyone
- **Future-proof:** The library is designed to stay up-to-date with Notion API changes, providing versioned compatibility with the latest updates.
- **Collaborative:** Built with the open-source community in mind, this library is extensible and encourages contributions.

---

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Pydantic Models:** Every Notion API entity (e.g., databases, pages, blocks, properties) is implemented as a Pydantic model.
- **Dynamic Parsing:** Automatically parse API responses into rich Python objects.
- **Validation-Friendly API Integration:** Ensure the data you send to or receive from Notion is valid and complete.
- **Namespace Organization:** Part of the broader `pydantic_api.*` ecosystem for standardizing API interactions.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install pydantic-notion
```

## Future Plans: Expanding to pydantic_api.*

`pydantic-notion` is part of a larger vision: **pydantic_api.***, a collection of libraries that aim to normalize and standardize data interactions across various APIs using Pydantic models.

### Examples of Future Libraries:
- **pydantic_api.github**: Comprehensive Pydantic models for the GitHub API.
- **pydantic_api.slack**: Standardized models for the Slack API, enabling seamless bot and app development.
- **pydantic_api.openai**: Rich Pydantic models for OpenAI's API, empowering AI developers with type-safe tools.

Our mission is to provide:
- **Unified APIs:** A consistent, type-safe experience across all supported APIs.
- **Better developer experience:** Simplified interaction with complex APIs through validated and self-documented models.
- **Community-driven development:** A collaborative ecosystem of contributors creating modular, reusable libraries.

If you have suggestions for APIs you'd like to see supported in the future, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo-link/issues) or start a discussion!
