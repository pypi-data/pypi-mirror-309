    <b>Agent that performs action on your system by executing code.</b>
</p>

<br>

**Emplode** Agent performs actions on your system by executing code locally, It can also serve as an agentic framework for your disposable sandbox projects. You can chat with Emplode in your terminal by running `emplode` after installing.

This provides a natural-language interface to your system's general-purpose capabilities:

- Create, edit and arrange files.
- Control a browser to perform research
- Plot, clean, and analyze large datasets
- ...etc.

<br>

## Quick Start

```shell
pip install emplode
```

### Terminal

After installation, simply run `emplode`:

```shell
emplode
```

### Python

```python
import emplode

emplode.chat("Organize all images in my downloads folder into subfolders by year, naming each folder after the year.") # Executes a single command
emplode.chat() # Starts an interactive chat
```

## Commands

### Change the Model

For `gpt-3.5-turbo`, use fast mode:

```shell
emplode --fast
```

In Python, you will need to set the model manually:

```python
emplode.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

### Running Emplode locally

You can run `emplode` in local mode from the command line to use `Code Llama`:

```shell
emplode --local
```

Or run any Hugging Face model **locally** by using its repo ID (e.g. "tiiuae/falcon-180B"):

```shell
emplode --model nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct
```


### Configuration with .env

Emplode allows you to set default behaviors using a .env file. This provides a flexible way to configure it without changing command-line arguments every time.

Here's a sample .env configuration:

```
EMPLODE_CLI_AUTO_RUN=False
EMPLODE_CLI_FAST_MODE=False
EMPLODE_CLI_LOCAL_RUN=False
EMPLODE_CLI_DEBUG=False
```

You can modify these values in the .env file to change the default behavior of the Emplode

## How Does it Work?

Emplode equips a [function-calling model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) with an `exec()` function, which accepts a `language` (like "Python" or "JavaScript") and `code` to run.
