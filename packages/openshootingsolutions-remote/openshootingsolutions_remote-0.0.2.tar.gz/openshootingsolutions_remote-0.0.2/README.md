# Open Shooting Solutions (OSS)
Open Source Shooting Solutions aimed at making shooting more easy and fun!

## About the Project
Hello, I'm Arnoud (Noud), and in my free time, I enjoy spending time at the shooting range, engaging in various disciplines and competitions. This project started from my passion for shooting and the need to simplify certain aspects of the sport.

Some shooting disciplines and competitions require adherence to specific time constraints or the memorization of numerous instructions. In response to this, I am developing tools that will help shooters.

The primary goal is to create a web application accessible across multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. While the exact feature set is still under consideration, here are some initial ideas:

- Timers configured with precise timing signals for each stage.
- Detailed shooting instructions for every stage.

Right now, I am in the process of translating these ideas into reality by building the base application. At present, Open Shooting Solutions is a one person project, which means support and feature requests may be limited. However, this could change in the future.

What I do offer is access to the source code and published Docker images once the application has progressed to a functional stage. This would enable individuals to host their private instances of the application.
