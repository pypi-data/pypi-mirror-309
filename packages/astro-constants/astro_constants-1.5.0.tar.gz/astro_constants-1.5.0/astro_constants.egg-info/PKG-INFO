# Astro Constants Library

Astro Constants is a Python library that provides a comprehensive collection of commonly used **astronomical** and **physical constants**. This library is designed for developers, researchers, educators, and astronomy enthusiasts to simplify calculations and projects related to astrophysics, cosmology, and space science.

## Features

- **Predefined Constants**:
  - Speed of Light (`SPEED_OF_LIGHT`)
  - Gravitational Constant (`GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT`)
  - Planck's Constant (`PLANCK_CONSTANT`)
  - Astronomical Unit (AU) (`ASTRONOMICAL_UNIT`)
  - Light Year (`LIGHT_YEAR`)
  - Parsec (`PARSEC`)
  - Masses and Radii of Celestial Bodies (Sun, Earth, Moon, Jupiter, etc.)
  - Surface Temperature of the Sun
  - Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Temperature
  - Orbital Periods (Earth, Moon)
  - Solar Luminosity
  - And many more!

- **Easy-to-Use**:
  - Access constants with simple Python imports for quick implementation.

- **Well-Documented**:
  - Full descriptions of all constants are provided to ensure clarity and usability.

## Installation

You can install the library directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/astro-constants/):

```bash
pip install astro-constants
```

## Usage

Import the library into your Python project and access constants:

```python
from astro_constants import SPEED_OF_LIGHT, MASS_OF_SUN

print(f"The speed of light is {SPEED_OF_LIGHT} m/s.")
print(f"The mass of the Sun is {MASS_OF_SUN} kg.")
```
