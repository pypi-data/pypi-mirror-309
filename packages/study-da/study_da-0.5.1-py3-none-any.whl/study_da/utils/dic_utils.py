This module provides utility functions for handling nested dictionaries and YAML files.

Functions:
    load_dic_from_path(path: str, ryaml: ruamel.yaml.YAML | None = None)
        -> tuple[dict, ruamel.yaml.YAML]:
        Load a dictionary from a YAML file.

    write_dic_to_path(dic: dict, path: str, ryaml: ruamel.yaml.YAML | None = None) -> None:
        Write a dictionary to a YAML file.

    nested_get(dic: dict, keys: list) -> Any:
        Get the value from a nested dictionary using a list of keys.

    nested_set(dic: dict, keys: list, value: Any) -> None:
        Set a value in a nested dictionary using a list of keys.

    find_item_in_dic(obj: dict, key: str) -> Any:
        Find an item in a nested dictionary.

    set_item_in_dic(obj: dict, key: str, value: Any, found: bool = False) -> None:
        Set an item in a nested dictionary.

    clean_dic(o: Any) -> None:
        Convert numpy types to standard types in a nested dictionary containing numbers and lists.
