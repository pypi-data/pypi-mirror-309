# An observation (10/25/2024)
# This agent implementation is fundamnetally flipped from how I've done it in
# the latest Go implementation. In that version, an agent "is a" spec and "has
# a" blackboard trasporter.  In this implementation, I've made an agent "be a"
# blackboard transporter type (network client) and it "has a" spec.  I wonder
# what the implications of that are and how much of a difference it would make
# to change to to be the other way around. I think that the current Go approach
# makes more sense.  An agent is (ideally ) inseparably defined from its
# specification, whereas it could talk to the blackboard ina number of different
# ways (http, grpc, both?)
#
# nvm, I do a "has a" for both the transporter and the spec.  We change  to do both here too.
# NOTE: This could add some semi-weird and undesirable pb message functionality to Agent. Will need
# to keep an eye on  this.
#
# NOTE: nvm again. We're back to where we started b/c we can't actually inherit from a pb2.AgentSpec type

    # NOTE: This is really the only function call in the Agent API (for now) that we could
    # reasonably "expect" to encounter an error state (i.e. unable to communicate with the bb
    # or otherwise getting bad error codes).  Error handling in the python api can't probably
    # shouldn't look like the go library. I think that'll make everyone unhappy.
    #
    # Some options:
    # - Each send_message can raise an exception that must be handled by the user.  This would be something like
    #   BlackboardCommunicationException so that we don't force the user to handle like 30 different exception
    #   types if playing that game is something they want to do.
    #   This means that if they don't want their agent to crash, then any call to the API MUST be wrapped in the
    #   following:
    #
    #   try:
    #       agt.hello()
    #   except BlackboardCommunicationException as bb_err:
    #       # handle or raise the exception
    #
    #   Regardless of how anyone else feels, I think I hate this. the "send_message" exception
    #   kind of bubbles out to all the other API calls.  If this is the "most pythonic" way, and peole like it,
    #   then I could support this, but I think it makes our code harder to read and write.
    #
    # - Don't do anything.  Let it fail, let it crash. Our users are developing agents and a stack trace is not
    #   the end of the world.  This essentially is the "must communicate with the blackboard" model and is not
    #   fault tolerant of the network.  This can probably work in certain environments but would likely require
    #   retooling for certain applications and deployment scenarios.
    #
    #   A major pro of this approach is that it requires zero-effort from us, which could be important right now while
    #   we prioritize developing real use cases.  It also kind of puts the onus on the network operator to be responsible
    #   for network quality, although in practice, this is likely to cause some frustration among users since
    #   most people do not have intimate knowledge of networking or run their own network.
