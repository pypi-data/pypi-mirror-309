xplor provides a unified framework for building Operation Research models using [polars](https://pola.rs/) DataFrames. By leveraging polars' performance and ergonomic API, xplor makes mathematical optimization more intuitive and maintainable.

## Features

- üöÄ **Polars Integration**: Built on top of polars for high-performance data operations
- üß© **Solver Agnostic**: Designed to support multiple solvers (currently Gurobi, more coming soon)
- üìù **Intuitive API**: Natural expression syntax for constraints and objectives
- ‚ö° **Vectorized Operations**: Efficient model building with DataFrame operations
- üîç **Type Hints**: Full typing support for better IDE integration

## Installation

```bash
pip install xplor
```

For Gurobi support, make sure you have Gurobi installed and licensed:
```bash
pip install gurobipy
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example showing how to build and solve an optimization model using xplor:

```python
import xplor.gurobi as pg
import polars as pl
import gurobipy as gp

# Create a model
model = gp.Model()

# Create sample data
df = pl.DataFrame({
    "i": [0, 0, 1, 2, 2],
    "j": [1, 2, 0, 0, 1],
    "u": [0.3, 1.2, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2],
    "c": [1.3, 1.7, 1.4, 1.1, 0.9],
    "obj": [2.5, 2.7, 1.2, 1.7, 3.9],
})

# Add variables and constraints
df = (
    df
    .pipe(pg.add_vars, model, name="x", ub="u", obj="obj", indices=["i", "j"])
    .pipe(pg.apply_eval, "y = 2 * x - c")
)

# Add constraints using grouped operations
(
    df
    .group_by("i")
    .agg(pg.quicksum("y"), pl.col("c").min())
    .pipe(pg.add_constrs, model, "y <= c", name="constr")
)

# Solve the model
model.optimize()

# Extract solution
solution = df.with_columns(pg.read_value("x"))
```

## Current Status

xplor is in active development. Currently supported:
- ‚úÖ Gurobi backend
- ‚úÖ Basic model building operations
- ‚úÖ Variable and constraint creation
- ‚úÖ Expression evaluation
- ‚úÖ Solution reading

Planned features:
- üöß Support for additional solvers (CPLEX, CBC, SCIP)
- üöß Extended modeling capabilities
- üöß Performance optimizations
- üöß More utility functions

## Why xplor?

xplor aims to modernize the Operation Research workflow by:
1. Using polars instead of pandas for better performance and memory usage
2. Providing a consistent API across different solvers
3. Making model building more intuitive with DataFrame operations
4. Enabling better code organization and maintenance

## Comparison with Other Tools

xplor is heavily inspired by [gurobipy-pandas](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobipy-pandas) but differs in these key aspects:
- Uses polars instead of pandas for better performance
- Designed to be solver-agnostic from the ground up
