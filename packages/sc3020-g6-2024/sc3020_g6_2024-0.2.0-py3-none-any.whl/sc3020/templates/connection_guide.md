This project needs to connect to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. If you have already set up the database with [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/), you can directly click the `Connect` button. Otherwise, you need to click the `Load Data` button after you connect to the database, it will download and load the data automatically from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pufanyi/TPC-H). It will take a while as the data is a bit large.
