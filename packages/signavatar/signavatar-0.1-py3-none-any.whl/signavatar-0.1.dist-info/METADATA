SignAvatar Library
The SignAvatar library enables developers to convert text into sign language gesture animations. Using Giphy API integrations, SignAvatar creates an animated GIF sequence to represent each word in the text, ideal for applications supporting inclusive communication for the deaf and mute.

Features
Fetches ASL gestures using Giphy API.
Combines individual GIFs into a single animation for smoother transitions.
Customizable animation speed, color style, and expressions.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
API Key: A Giphy API key is required to fetch GIFs.
Step 1: Clone Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/signavatar.git
Step 2: Install Required Packages
bash
Copy code
pip install requests pillow imageio
Configuration
Obtain a Giphy API key from the Giphy Developer Portal.
Place the API key in your code as api_key parameter for SignAvatar.
Usage
Initializing SignAvatar
python
Copy code
from signavatar import SignAvatar

api_key =  "AHgXT1TDdpVGJhlx9hsw4pOwFyqClNM"
avatar = SignAvatar(api_key, default_speed="normal", style={"color": "blue", "brightness": 0.8}, expression="happy")
Generating Sign Animations
Convert a sentence into sign language animations:

python
Copy code
avatar.sign("Hello how are you")
Methods
get_gif_url(word): Fetches a GIF URL from Giphy for a given word.
sign(text, speed): Generates a merged animation for a sentence.
merge_and_display_gifs(gif_urls): Merges individual GIFs into one animation for display.
Example Output
The merged GIF will display an animated sequence of gestures corresponding to each word in the input text.

Troubleshooting
Error Fetching GIFs: Check if the API key is valid and if there are network issues.
Error Merging GIFs: Ensure all URLs are valid and point to existing GIF files.
