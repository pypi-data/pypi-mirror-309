    Calculate the circumference of the Earth.

    The function uses the formula 2 * pi * radius, where the default radius 
    is 6371.0 kilometers (the average radius of Earth).

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the Earth in kilometers. Defaults to 6371.0.

    Returns:
        float: The circumference of the Earth in kilometers.

    Note:
        This is an approximation as Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid,
        meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.
        The radius used here is an average value.
