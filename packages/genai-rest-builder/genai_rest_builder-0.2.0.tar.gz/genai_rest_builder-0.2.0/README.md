The **GenAI REST Builder** is a tool for rapidly creating RESTful services around AI models, allowing you to define service configurations in a YAML file and generate a FastAPI-based project structure to deploy AI-powered endpoints.

## Key Features

- **Service Configuration with Custom Prompts**: Easily define each service's prompt, model configuration, and provider-specific details in YAML format.
- **Cloud Provider Compatibility**: Supports major providers, including AWS and Azure, to integrate directly with cloud-based AI services.
- **Automated Code and Endpoint Generation**: Generates FastAPI service endpoints, configuration files, and utility scripts based on YAML specifications.

## Installation

1. **Install the GenAI REST Builder Tool**:

   Begin by installing the `genai-rest-builder` package:

   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml genai-rest-builder
   ```

2. **Generate Project Structure**:

   Use the command below to generate the project structure with REST APIs for all defined services based on the YAML configuration file:

   ```bash
   genai-rest-proj-build
   ```

   This reads from `prompt_service.yaml` (to be created by the user with service definitions) and generates the required project files, configurations, and the main FastAPI application.

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:

   After generating the project structure, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:

   Launch the FastAPI server with `serve_app.py`:

   ```bash
   python serve_app.py
   ```

   By default, the server runs on `localhost:8080` unless overridden in the `.env` file.

## Example YAML - `prompt_service.yaml` Configuration File

Below is an example structure for defining services in the YAML configuration file:

```yaml
PromptServices:
  - <servicename>:
      prompt: <prompt template>
      model:
        provider: [aws, azure]
        modelId: <model id>
        temperature: <temperature>
        maxTokens: <maximum tokens>
        apiVersion: <api version>  # Required for Azure provider
```

### YAML Configuration Details

- **servicename**: Unique identifier for the service.
- **prompt**: Template text for the AI model’s prompt.
- **model**: Contains model details:
  - **provider**: Cloud provider (`aws` or `azure`).
  - **modelId**: Identifier for the specific model.
  - **temperature**: Controls the randomness of the model's output.
  - **maxTokens**: Maximum tokens to be generated by the model.
  - **apiVersion**: _(Azure only)_ Specifies the API version of the Azure model.

## Project Structure

After running the project build command, the following structure will be created:

```
.
├── service_chains/
│   ├── <servicename>_chain.py           # Generated chain files for each service
│   ├── utils.py                         # Helper functions to load service configurations
│   ├── __init__.py                      # Package initialization file
├── serve_app.py                         # Main FastAPI application
├── .env                                 # Environment configuration file with host/port settings
├── requirements.txt                     # Project dependencies file
├── prompt_service.yaml                  # YAML configuration file (user-defined)
```

## Accessing API Documentation

Once the server is running, OpenAPI documentation is available at:

```
http://<GENAI_SERVER_HOST>:<GENAI_SERVER_PORT>/docs
```

This page provides an interactive interface to test and explore the API endpoints.

## Invoking Services

Each service can be accessed via a unique REST API path based on the service name:

```
http://<GENAI_SERVER_HOST>:<GENAI_SERVER_PORT>/<service>
```

Replace `<service>` with the name specified in the YAML configuration file to send requests to the corresponding service.
