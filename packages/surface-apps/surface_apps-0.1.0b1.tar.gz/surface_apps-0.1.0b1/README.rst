Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Online documentation <https://surface-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**surface-apps** is currently written for Python 3.10 or higher.

Install Conda
-------------

To install **surface-apps**, you need to install **Conda** first.

We recommend to install **Conda** using `miniforge`_.

.. _miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Within a conda environment
--------------------------

You can install (or update) a conda environment with all the requires packages to run **surface-apps**.
To do so you can directly run the **Install_or_Update.bat** file by double left clicking on it.

Install with conda
------------------

You can install the package using ``conda`` and the ``.lock`` files from a conda prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda env create --solver libmamba -n my-env -f environments/[the_desired_env].lock.yml

Install with PyPI
-----------------

You should not install the package from PyPI, as the app requires conda packages to run.
Still, you can install it in a prepared conda environment, telling ``pip`` not to install dependencies
thanks to the ``--no-deps`` option.

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

To install the **surface-apps** package published on PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --no-deps surface-apps

From a Git tag or branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the revision of the package is not on PyPI yet, you can install it from a Git tag:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --no-deps --force-reinstall https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/surface-apps/archive/refs/tags/TAG.zip

Or to install the latest changes available on a given Git branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --no-deps --force-reinstall https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/surface-apps/archive/refs/heads/BRANCH.zip

.. note::
    The ``--force-reinstall`` option is used to make sure the updated version
    of the sources is installed, and not the cached version, even if the version number
    did not change. The ``-U`` or ``--upgrade`` option is used to make sure to get the latest version,
    on not merely reinstall the same version. As the package is aimed to be in a **Conda environment**, the option ``--no-deps`` is used to avoid installing the dependencies with pip, as they will be installed with conda.

From a local copy of the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a git clone of the package sources locally,
you can install **surface-apps** from the local copy of the sources with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --force-reinstall path/to/project_folder_with_pyproject_toml

Or in **editable mode**, so that you can edit the sources and see the effect immediately at runtime:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e -U --force-reinstall path/to/project_folder_with_pyproject_toml
