## Installation

`pyro_dash_py` has a public [pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/pyro-dash-py/) that you can install.

```bash
pip install pyro_dash_py
```

## Speed Run Usage

First, initialize the `PyroDash` client, make sure you are specifying your own api key.

```python
pyro = PyroDash(
    host="https://api.dashboard.pyrologix.com",
    email="dev@pyrologix.com",
    apikey="my-super-secret-key",
)
```

Now you can create some projects and jobs:

```python
my_project = pyro.projects.create(name="Hello from pyro_dash_py")
my_job = pyro.jobs.create("wildest")

my_project.add_job(my_job.id)
```

## For Contributors

This project uses poetry to manage dependencies and virtual environments. You're gonna need that.

You can follow the installation instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) or you can just run the command below:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
source ~/.zshrc # or whatever shell you're using
```

Then you can clone this repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyrologix/pyro_dash_py.git
poetry install --with dev

# and you should be able to run the test suite
poetry run pytest
```

You are encouraged to check out the `examples/` in order to get a feel for usage.
