# glidertest

This is a repo to diagnose issues in glider data such as CTD thermal lag.

This is a work in progress, all contributions welcome!

### Install

Install from PyPI with

```sh
python -m pip install glidertest
```

Install a local, development version of this by cloning the repo, opening a terminal in the home directory (next to this readme file) and running these commands:

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e . 
```
This installs glidertest locally. -e ensures that any edits you make in the files will be picked up by scripts that import functions from glidertest.

### Documentation

Documentation website at [https://callumrollo.github.io/glidertest/](https://callumrollo.github.io/glidertest/)

Check out the example notebook `notebooks/demo.ipynb` for example functionality

As input, glidertest takes [OceanGliders format files](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual)

### Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Please clone the repo and install a local development version of `glidertest` as described in the Install section above. All new functions should include tests, you can run the tests locally and generate a coverage report with:

```sh
pytest --cov=glidertest --cov-report term-missing  tests/
```

Try to ensure that all the lines of your contribution are covered in the tests.
