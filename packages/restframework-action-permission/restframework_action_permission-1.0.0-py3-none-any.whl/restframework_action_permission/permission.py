    DjangoActionPermissions

    Given an action and a request checks if the user has the permission to access
    the action. It is completely dependable on django auth package and the way it handles permissions. The core part of this class is a permission mapper which maps the requested action to the corresponding permission with specific codename.
    The default mapping is as follow and could be overwritten:

    list: list_(model_name)
    retrieve: view_(model_name)
    create: add_(model_name)
    destroy: delete_(model_name)
    update: change_(model_name)
    partial_update: change_(model_name)

    Note that all permissions is created by Django's auth pacakge except list_(model_name), which should be created automatically for every model after it's migration.
