A desktop tool to monitor GitHub Pull Requests with native notifications.

The code is pretty bad, as it was mostly written by claude-sonnet 3.5.

It works though, for the most part, and I've checked it to make sure it's not doing anything crazy.

This was equally about creating a useful tool for work, as well as playing around with LLMs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install github-pr-watcher
```

If that doesn't work, try using a versioned variant like `pip3.11 install github-pr-watcher` or `pipx`.

or download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/gm2211/github-watcher/releases).

## First Run

When running the application for the first time, the statistics visualization may take a moment to initialize as it builds font caches and loads required libraries. Subsequent runs will be much faster.

To pre-build the font cache during installation, run:

```bash
python -m github
```

## Usage

```bash
github-pr-watcher
```
or
```bash
gpw
```
or, if you have downloaded the release:
```bash
cd /path/to/github-pr-watcher && run.sh
```
