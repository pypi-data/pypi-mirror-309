Allow editing X11 fields with terminal editor in $VISUAL.  Use keyboard
automation to select-all and copy text from the field, save it into a file,
edit that file with the terminal editor, and when the editor is done, read the
(presumably modified) text back from the file and paste it over the original
text.
