# BEST data set. 
# ! 1 eog, 1 ECG, ALL GOOD. Ecg only has problem at SID:  
# 022 - probably event detected wrong. after the event, there is a much larger peak, more likely to be R wave. Hence the wrong detection of my algorythm, cos it relies on time 0 of the event.
# 012, 009 - very flat peaks, hard to find which to flip. 012 - which peak is actually the R wave: -0.03 or -0.01? Again might be problem with tine0 detection
